Here, we tested the hypothesis that young adult heavy drinkers with family histories of alcohol misuse would show a stronger association specifically between low evening substance-free reinforcement and alcohol problems compared to those without a family history of alcohol misuse. Participants were 317 college students reporting heavy episodic drinking (M-age = 18.8, SD = 1.1, 61% female, 79% White) who completed a questionnaire about engagement and enjoyment in rewarding activities not involving substance use after 7 p.m., along with measures of personal and parental alcohol use/problems. Evening substance-free reinforcement was negatively associated with typical drinking level for women, but not for men. Family history status did not show a significant association with typical alcohol consumption or evening substance-free reinforcement (operationalized as activity participation x enjoyment), but did show a significant association with alcohol problems. Evening substance-free reinforcement was significantly negatively related to alcohol problems for both men and women. However, the presence of a family history of alcohol misuse moderated this relationship, such that only individuals with familial risk for alcohol misuse who reported lower evening substance-free reinforcement evidenced greater alcohol-related problems. These findings suggest that lower evening substance-free reinforcement is associated with alcohol misuse among young adults, and that this association is exacerbated among individuals with familial risk for developing alcohol problems.","2018-12","2018-12-21 16:22:16","2018-12-21 16:22:16","","560-569","","6","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test the hypothesis that negative interpretation bias contributes to worry and rumination, we assessed the effects of inducing more positive interpretations in reducing RNT. Method: Volunteers diagnosed with GAD (66) or depression (65) were randomly allocated to one of two versions of cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I), either with or without RNT priming prior to training, or a control condition, each involving 10 Internet-delivered sessions. Outcome measures of interpretation bias, a behavioral RNT task and self-reported worry, rumination, anxiety and depression were obtained at baseline, after home-based training and at 1-month follow-up (self-report questionnaires only). Results: CBM-I training, across diagnostic groups, promoted a more positive interpretation bias and led to reductions in worry, rumination, and depressive symptoms, which were maintained at follow-up. Anxiety symptoms were reduced only in the GAD group at follow-up. There were no differences between CBM-I versions; brief priming of RNT did not influence CBM-I effectiveness. Level of interpretation bias post training partially mediated the effects of CBM-I on follow-up questionnaire scores. Conclusions: In contrast to some recent failures to demonstrate improvements following Internet-delivered CBM, we found that self-reported RNT and negative mood were reduced by CBM-I. This is consistent with a causal role for negative interpretation bias in both worry and rumination, suggesting a useful role for CBM-I within treatments for anxiety and depression.","2018-12","2018-12-21 16:22:16","2018-12-21 16:22:16","","1017-1030","","12, SI","86","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive bias modification (CBM); depression; generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); interpretation bias; repetitive negative thinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A moderated mediation model is hypothesized where teacher child interaction quality predicts children's literacy outcomes via their reading attitudes, but the strength of this whole mediation process is moderated by the level of teacher-child interaction quality. A sample of 567 Chinese kindergarteners from 29 classrooms was recruited to test the hypothesized model using a longitudinal design. The results support our assumptions: teacher's emotional support had a positive effect on children's reading attitudes, which in turn had a positive effect on their reading and vocabulary learning outcomes. Three domains of teacher-child interaction quality at the baseline together were associated with children's Chinese reading through later classroom organization. Moreover, children with better reading attitudes benefited more from higher instructional support and then gained more vocabulary learning achievement.

We tested the hypothesis that representational coexistence holds even after extensive experience with Christian theology, as indexed by age. Christian religious adherents ranging in age from 18 to 87 years were asked to evaluate as true or false statements on which core knowledge intuitions about persons and Christian theology about God were consistent (both true or both false) or inconsistent (true on one and false on the other). Results showed, across adulthood, more theological errors in evaluating inconsistent versus consistent statements. Older adults also exhibited slower response times to inconsistent versus consistent statements. These findings show that despite extensive experience, indeed a lifetime of experience for some participants, the Christian theological God concept does not separate from the initial person concept from which it is formed. In fact, behavioral signatures of representational coexistence were not attenuated by experience. We discuss the broader implications of these findings to the acquisition of evolutionarily new concepts.","2018-12","2018-12-21 16:22:17","2018-12-21 16:22:17","","2330-2338","","6","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Conceptual change; Core knowledge; God concept; Person concept; Religious beliefs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bootstrap analysis revealed that a higher AD polygenic risk score was associated with lower cognitive scores at baseline through higher neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, and lower levels of the industriousness facet of conscientiousness. In addition, a higher polygenic score for AD was associated with decline in cognition over four years in part through higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness. The findings support the hypothesis that the genetic vulnerability for AD contributes to cognitive functioning in part through its association with personality traits.","2018-12","2018-12-21 16:22:17","2018-12-21 16:22:17","","110-113","","","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cognition; Facets; Personality; Polygenic risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the causes of these inequalities have been difficult to pin down. One line of work suggests the inequalities in arrest may be traced to inequalities in exposure to school discipline. Specifically, the school-to-prison pipeline literature suggests inequalities in school disciplinary practices may go on to produce inequalities in arrest prevalence. In this article, we draw on a large nationally representative sample to test the hypothesis that racial inequalities in school-based punishments will (partially) explain inequalities in adulthood arrest. We find support for this pathway and, by drawing on recent developments in epidemiology, produce initial estimates of the degree to which policymakers might be able to close the racial gap in arrest if it were possible to close the racial gap in school discipline.","2018-12","2018-12-21 16:22:17","2018-12-21 16:22:17","","2328-2340","","12","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","arrest; mediation; racial inequalities; school-to-prison pipeline; suspension/expulsion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we study auditory contributions to this process using the ambiguous bouncing/streaming display. Typically, a brief coinciding tone alters this dynamic event toward the perception of 2 disks bouncing off each other rather than streaming past each other. In 4 experiments, we tested the hypothesis that this crossmodal interaction is primarily driven by additive contributions of sensory transients rather than by the high-level processing of sound category. We orthogonally manipulated the number and semantic category of auditory transients. Specifically, different combinations of auditory transients generate qualitatively different events with distinct meanings; a single auditory transient can be a tone onset or offset, and a pair of transients can be a brief tone (onset + offset) or a brief gap (offset + onset). The proportion of seeing bouncing was larger for 2 transients than 1 transient and larger for 1 transient than no transients regardless of the sound's semantic category. A tone onset and a tone offset were equally effective (relative to no transients), and a brief tone (onset + offset) and a brief gap (offset + onset) were equivalently more effective. We identified a critical window of +/- 200 ms around the visual overlap; a longer tone whose offset occurred outside the window was only as effective as a single onset. These results suggest that a simple addition of auditory transients within the critical time window primarily contributes to the auditory biasing of visual bouncing percepts.","2018-12","2018-12-21 16:22:18","2018-12-21 16:22:18","","1995-2004","","12","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","audio-visual interaction; auditory transients; bouncing/streaming illusion; onset versus offset; SOA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that those who have successfully maintained weight loss may have superior self-control compared to control participants. Self-control was assessed using a delay discounting task through a webbased assessment of members of the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR: N=757; non-obese=605; obese=152) and control participants (Control N=443; nonobese = 236; obese=207) from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Both NWCR members that were currently obese (t =5.42, p<0.001) and nonobese (t=5.28, p<0.001) discounted the future less than control participants with comparable weight statuses. These results are indicative of higher levels of self-control behaviors in individuals that have lost and successfully maintained weight loss. Thus, successful weight losers may exhibit stronger self-control, as measured through discounting of future rewards, However, further research is needed to determine whether strong selfcontrol enables individuals to succeed at weight loss maintenance or develops as a consequence.","2018-12","2018-12-21 16:22:18","2018-12-21 16:22:18","","891-896","","6","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Delay discounting; Impulsivity; Self-control; Weight loss; Weight loss maintenance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test the hypotheses, a longitudinal cross-lag path model was tested with structural equation modelling. Consistent with the main hypothesis, adolescents who received a greater number of malicious texts were found to be more likely one year later to engage in self-harming. In addition, self-harming predicted higher levels of both sending and receiving malicious texts one year later, suggesting that self-aggression may be related to other-aggression. And last, a reciprocal relationship between sending and receiving malicious texts was noted, lending support to the view that peers often retaliate against individuals who send aggressive texts.

We know little about whether psychological characteristics, such as fear of negative evaluation (FNE), which is also associated with heightened perception of threats from others, may amplify or attenuate perceptions of safety in the presence of the police. We used linear multiple regression to test the hypothesis that perceptions of safety in the presence of same- and different- race police officers would be lower among members of a group with heightened perceptions of police mistreatment (African Americans), particularly those who also endorse high levels of FNE, than among European Americans, regardless of their levels of FNE. Our findings indicate that the interaction between participant race and FNE significantly predicted safety feelings in the presence of police officers, particularly those from a racial outgroup.

However, studies investigating the mechanisms underlying this relation are limited. Since affective empathy may be associated with a feeling of exaggerated responsibility for alleviating the suffering of others, it may lead to high levels of generalized guilt and various forms of shame, which, in turn, may elevate depressive symptoms. Therefore, these self-conscious emotions are candidate mediators of the affective empathy-depressive symptoms relationship. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that generalized and contextual shame and generalized guilt mediate the relations between affective empathy and depressive symptoms. Methods: 117 inpatient adolescents completed the Basic Empathy Scale to assess affective and cognitive empathy, the Beck Depression Inventory-II to evaluate severity of depressive symptoms, the Test of Self-Conscious Affect that measures contextual guilt and shame, and the Personal Feelings Questionnaire that assess generalized guilt and shame. Results: Findings demonstrated that generalized guilt, contextual and generalized shame mediated the relation between affective empathy and depressive symptoms. In contrast, cognitive empathy was shown to be related most strongly to contextual guilt and was unrelated to depressive symptoms. Limitations: Characteristics of the sample (predominately Caucasian inpatient adolescents from well-educated and financially stable environments), the lack of a longitudinal design, and over-reliance on self-report measures were main limitations of the study. Conclusions: The study provides novel information on the mechanisms underlying the association between affective empathy and depressive symptoms and shows that shame and generalized guilt associated with affective sharing should be considered as possible targets for therapeutic/preventive interventions for adolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms.","2018-12-01","2018-12-21 16:22:19","2018-12-21 16:22:19","","381-387","","","241","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Affective empathy; Cognitive empathy; Depression; Guilt; Shame","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would counteract the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of CF. Twenty young healthy participants were tested in a within-subject counterbalanced order across two different days. Anodal tDCS (real vs. sham) was applied over the left prefrontal cortex. In the real tDCS condition, a current of 1.5 mA was delivered for 25 min. Cortical oxygenation changes were measured using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) on the frontal cortices. CF was triggered using the TloadDback task, a sustained working memory paradigm that allows tailoring task demands according to each individual's maximal cognitive capacity. Sustained cognitive load-related effects were assessed using pre-versus post-task subjective fatigue and sleepiness scales, evolution of performance accuracy within the task, indirect markers of dopaminergic activity (eye blinks), and cortical oxygenation changes (fNIRS) both during the task and pre- and post-task resting state periods. Results consistently disclosed significant CF-related effects on performance. Transcranial DCS was not effective to counteract the behavioral effects of CF. In the control (sham tDCS) condition, cerebral oxygen exchange (COE) levels significantly increased in the right hemisphere during the resting state immediately after the induction of CF, suggesting a depletion of brain resources. In contrast, tDCS combined with CF induction significantly shifted interhemispheric oxygenation balance during the post-training resting state. Additionally, increased self-reported sleepiness was associated with brain activity in the stimulated hemisphere after recovery from CF during the tDCS condition only, which might reflect a negative middle-term effect of tDCS application.","2018-11-30","2018-12-21 16:22:19","2018-12-21 16:22:19","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive fatigue; fNIRS; inter-hemispheric balance; sleepiness; sustained attention; tDCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theory-driven hypotheses for selecting the best treatments have not yet been adequately investigated. The present study tested the a priory hypothesis that attachment orientations may determine whether patients benefit more from a treatment where alliance provides a facilitative environment for the treatment to work, as in the case of supportive-expressive psychotherapy, vs. where alliance is conceptualized as an active ingredient in itself, as in the case of supportive psychotherapy.Method/designTo test the hypothesis that attachment orientation moderates the effect of treatment condition on outcome, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT). One hundred patients are randomized to 16 sessions of either supportive-expressive or supportive psychotherapy for MDD, conducted by experienced psychologists. The primary outcome is change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Secondary outcome measures include self-reported depressive and other symptoms, psychological and interpersonal functioning, quality of life, and the presence of the diagnosis of depression. Additional measures include hormonal levels, motion synchrony, and acoustic attributes, performance on cognitive tasks, and narrative material (collected from the sessions and from interviews).DiscussionThe RCT will expand our understanding of how the outcome of treatment can be optimized by identifying the most promising role of alliance in treatment, based on patients' pre-treatment attachment orientation. Results will contribute to the ongoing theoretical debate concerning the differential efficacy of various psychotherapeutic approaches for patients with different attachment orientations. The RCT will also contribute to progress toward personalized treatment by informing therapists about which of two approaches are most effective with patients based on their attachment styles.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02728557 submitted on the 15.3.16.

This study consisted of 3 online experiments implemented via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants were presented with videos (Experiment 1) or vignettes (Experiments 2, 3) describing situations in which everyday commitments were violated. Participants then reported their perceptions, interpretations, and affective and behavioral responses to those situations. Participants' BPD traits (BPDt) were assessed using the short form of the Five-Factor Borderline Inventory on the basis of which they were divided into two groups: High and Low BPDt. The results revealed that participants with High BPD traits were less optimistic about others acting in accordance with an implicit sense of commitment (Experiment 1), although there was no difference between groups when the commitment was explicitly stated (Experiment 3). Participants in the High BPDt group also reported heightened emotional responses (Experiments 1-3) and less adaptive behavioral responses (Experiments 1, 3) to perceived or anticipated violations of commitment. Our findings suggest that high levels of BPD traits may give rise to a difficulty in adapting one's social expectations and behavior in light of interpersonal commitments and in a manner that is calibrated to the social norms in the community. Future research should investigate to what extent a disturbed sense of commitment may contribute to the difficulties in interpersonal functioning experienced by many individuals with a clinical diagnosis of BPD.","2018-11-06","2018-12-21 16:22:20","2018-12-21 16:22:20","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","borderline personality traits; commitment; coordination; joint action; social expectations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding psychiatric rehospitalizations offers an opportunity to identify weaknesses in current systems of care. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a history of trauma or ongoing bullying increases the risk of psychiatric rehospitalization. Method: Retrospective cohort study of 366 individual patients (71% female) admitted to a pediatric psychiatry unit between 1/1/2015 and 12/31/2015. The primary outcome measure was rehospitalization to the same psychiatric hospital unit within one year of first discharge. Trauma was defined as having a history of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Reactive Attachment Disorder, or a filed Suspected Abuse and Neglect of a Child report by the end of first hospitalization. Ongoing bullying was identified by medical record review. Results: History of trauma (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.2, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.8-5.6, p < 0.0001) and ongoing bullying (OR = 2.2, CI = 1.2-3.9, p = 0.009) were significantly associated with increased rates of rehospitalizations.

Daily relationship processes may be instrumental in regulating FCR as triggers of existential distress are encountered. We tested the hypothesis that daily capitalization, the process of sharing good news (capitalization attempts) to a partner perceived as responsive (responsiveness), buffers patient and spouse FCR as they confront the first mammogram post-diagnosis. Methods Results Fifty-seven early-stage BC survivors and their spouses reported daily FCR, capitalization, and positivity of the disclosed event during a 3-week diary period beginning 2 weeks before the first annual mammogram post-diagnosis. Dyadic multilevel path models estimated within-person effects of patient and spouse capitalization on same-day FCR, controlling for event positivity. Before the mammogram, capitalization attempts were unrelated to FCR, but for patients, responsiveness was predictive of greater same-day FCR. After the mammogram, for both partners, attempts were predictive of greater same-day FCR, yet responsiveness was predictive of lower FCR. Conclusions Findings were largely inconsistent with the hypothesis that capitalization buffers existential distress. However, results revealed novel insights about daily dyadic processes that may characterize within-person adaptation to existential threat. Potential explanations for the differential links between capitalization and FCR based on timing (before versus after threat) and capitalization component (attempts versus responsiveness) are discussed.","2018-11","2018-12-21 16:22:21","2018-12-21 16:22:21","","2581-2586","","11, SI","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","breast cancer; cancer; capitalization; close relationships; daily diaries; fear of cancer recurrence; oncology; responsiveness; survivorship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study seeks to apply a behavioral economic framework to Internet use, testing the hypothesis that, similar to other addictive behaviors, problematic Internet use is a reinforcer pathology, reflecting an overvaluation of an immediately acquirable reward relative to prosocial and delayed rewards. Data were collected through Amazon's Mechanical Turk data collection platform. A total of 256 adults (M-age = 27.87, SD = 4.79; 58.2% White, 23% Asian; 65.2% had an associate degree or greater) completed the survey. Measures of delay discounting, consideration of future consequences, Internet demand, and alternative reinforcement all contributed unique variance in predicting both problematic Internet use and Internet craving. In aggregate models controlling for all significant predictors, alternative reinforcement and future valuation variables contributed unique variance. Individuals with elevated demand and discounting were at greatest risk for problematic Internet use.

The underlying neural mechanisms remain uncertain, yet arterial baroreceptor signaling, occurring at cardiac systole, is implicated. We examined normotensives using functional neuroimaging and pain stimulation during distinct phases of the cardiac cycle to test the hypothesized neural mediation of baroreceptor-induced attenuation of pain. Methods Eighteen participants (10 women; 32.7 (6.5) years) underwent BP monitoring for 1 week at home, and individual pain thresholds were determined in the laboratory. Subsequently, participants were administered unpredictable painful and nonpainful electrocutaneous shocks (stimulus type), timed to occur either at systole or at diastole (cardiac phase) in an event-related design. After each trial, participants evaluated their subjective experience. Results Subjective pain was lower for painful stimuli administered at systole compared with diastole, F(1, 2283) = 4.82, p = 0.03. Individuals with higher baseline BP demonstrated overall lower pain perception, F(1, 2164) = 10.47, p < .0001. Within the brain, painful stimulation activated somatosensory areas, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, posterior insula, amygdala, and the thalamus. Stimuli delivered during systole (concurrent with baroreceptor discharge) activated areas associated with heightened parasympathetic drive. No stimulus type by cardiac phase interaction emerged except for a small cluster located in the right parietal cortex. Conclusions We confirm the negative associations between BP and pain, highlighting the antinociceptive impact of baroreceptor discharge. Neural substrates associated with baroreceptor/BP-related hypoalgesia include superior parietal lobule, precentral, and lingual gyrus, regions typically involved in the cognitive aspects of pain experience.","2018-12","2018-12-21 16:22:21","2018-12-21 16:22:21","","845-852","","9, SI","80","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","baroreceptors; blood pressure; fMRI; hypoalgesia; pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The navigation is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. It uses the Microsoft Kinect to obtain information on the user's movement. The user walks in place to move forward in the virtual world and turns her shoulders to invoke rotations in the virtual world to make turns. The virtual world includes simulated pedestrians to enhance the immersion and is equipped with a number of sensors that allow for a multi-method measuring of users. After the implementation of hands free steering two case studies are used to provide first evidence with respect to the possible answers that the research infrastructure is capable of delivering. The validity of the model for steering has been explored using a case study involving parallel test groups that expose individuals to wayfinding exercises in both the real world and the corresponding virtual world. Our results show that the objective distances and times in the real and the virtual worlds, as well as perceptions of distances, times and directions, do not differ statistically significantly. This provides a partial validation of the model for steering. In a second larger case study the hypothesis was tested that using the virtual environment test persons are able to find their way also in complex multilevel infrastructures with only limited learning requirements. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that also in this setting realistic paths (including elevator and escalator usage) are taken by the test persons while observing realistic average velocities over longer trips. We find that our hypotheses have not been rejected by the data. Therefore, this environment is a useful tool for the design of guiding systems for large pedestrian infrastructures.

Combining extant stress models with theoretical considerations from team research, we address temporal variations in the buffering effect of trust in teammates. We hypothesize that trust buffers the negative effect of objective physical activity on perceived strain and that this buffering effect is more pronounced during later performance episodes (i.e., when employees complete a series of temporally distinguishable tasks). We tested the hypotheses with a sample of professional firefighters who completed a sequence of 3 performance episodes in a high-fidelity simulation environment. Each participant was equipped with a smartphone capturing individual motion activity, which we used as an indicator of physical activity. In line with our hypotheses, multilevel modeling revealed a buffering effect of trust on the relationship between physical activity and perceived strain. Importantly, this buffering effect was more pronounced in the second performance episode as compared with the first performance episode. Our findings add a temporal perspective to the understanding of the effectiveness of job resources. In addition, the current study illustrates the usefulness of smartphones for obtaining behavioral data in a naturalistic setting.","2018-11","2018-12-21 16:22:22","2018-12-21 16:22:22","","1099-1112","","9, SI","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","high-reliability occupations; social sensing; teams; time; trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we study ethnographic observations of post-marital residence in societies from five large language families (Austronesian, Bantu, Indo-European, Pama-Nyungan and Uto-Aztecan), encompassing 371 ethnolinguistic groups ranging widely in local ecologies and lifeways, and covering over half the worlds population and geographical area. We apply Bayesian comparative methods to test the hypothesis that post-marital residence patterns have evolved in similar ways across different geographical regions. By reconstructing past post-marital residence states, we compare transition rates and models of evolution across groups, while integrating the historical descent relationships of human societies. We find that each language family possesses its own best fitting model, demonstrating that the mode and pace of post-marital residence evolution is lineage-specific rather than global.","2018-11","2018-12-21 16:22:22","2018-12-21 16:22:22","","594-601","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bayesian phylogenetics; Cross-cultural comparison; Kinship; Post-marital residence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our previous work using Swedish record-linkage data found that rates of diagnosed eating disorders vary between schools, with higher proportions of girls and higher proportions of highly educated parents within a school being associated with greater numbers of diagnosed eating disorders. We aimed to extend these findings to a UK population-based sample and hypothesised that a similar association would be evident when studying disordered eating behaviours. We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to test the hypothesis that prevalence of self- and parent-reported disordered eating behaviours (binge eating, purging, fasting, restrictive eating, and fear of weight gain), and body dissatisfaction cluster by school. We had complete data on body dissatisfaction, school attended, and other possible risk factors for 2146 girls in 263 schools at age 14 and on disordered eating behaviours for 1769 girls in 273 schools at age 16. We used multilevel logistic regression modelling to assess whether prevalence varied between and within schools, and logistic regression to investigate the association between specific school characteristics and prevalence of disordered eating behaviours and body dissatisfaction. At age 14, there was no evidence for body dissatisfaction clustering by school, or for specific school characteristics being associated with body dissatisfaction. At age 16, there was no evidence for clustering, but higher rates of disordered eating behaviours were associated with attending all-girl schools and lower levels with attending schools with higher academic results. We found no evidence for clustering of disordered eating behaviours in individual schools, possibly because of the small cluster sizes. However, we found evidence for higher levels of disordered eating behaviours in 16years in all-girl schools, and in schools with lower academic performance.","2018-11","2018-12-21 16:22:23","2018-12-21 16:22:23","","1473-1481","","11","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ALSPAC; Body dissatisfaction; Disordered eating; Eating disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study examined the concurrent relations between maternal employment status and family characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status/SES, family structure) in Taiwanese families, and the unique relations of maternal employment and family SES to maternal stress, parenting beliefs, and preschoolers' socioemotional adjustment. In a school-based sample of 511 preschoolers (age range=4-6 years, 52.9% girls), their mothers, and teachers in Taipei and Taitung, mothers reported their employment status, family characteristics, perceived stress and parenting beliefs. Mothers and teachers rated preschoolers' adjustment. Results showed that compared to unemployed mothers in Taiwan, employed mothers were more likely to come from families with higher SES and fewer children, and nuclear (vs. extended) families. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. Mothers from lower-SES families reported higher stress and higher endorsement of coercive parenting, and lower endorsement of authoritative parenting than mothers from higher-SES families. Controlling for SES, employed mothers endorsed higher coercive parenting than unemployed mothers. Mothers' endorsement of authoritative parenting was associated with better child adjustment by mothers' (but not teachers') reports, whereas maternal stress and coercive parenting were associated with poorer child adjustment (by mothers' reports only). In sum, maternal employment was intricately associated with family SES in Taiwanese families, and the two contextual factors shape parenting and child adjustment in different processes.","2018-11","2018-12-21 16:22:23","2018-12-21 16:22:23","","3506-3519","","11","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Maternal employment; Maternal stress; Parenting beliefs; Preschoolers' adjustment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It replicated the sex difference in EI and showed that controlling for loneliness and self-esteem did not account for this difference. Study 2 replicated this pattern using an online sample, and tested the hypothesis that this difference may be mediated by the sex difference in endorsement of communal and agentic values. We found that sex differences in endorsement of communal (but not agentic) values mediated the sex difference in EI. However, agentic value endorsement played no role. These findings indicate that men may be higher in existential isolation because they do not endorse communal values as much as women do. This suggests that one way to reduce the disproportionate experience of EI among men may be to increase their endorsement of communal values.","2018-11-01","2018-12-21 16:22:24","2018-12-21 16:22:24","","283-288","","","134","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Communal and agentic values; Existential isolation; Loneliness; Sex differences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our research proposes that goal regulation in the workplace may have consequences for creativity. While there is an increasing trend for organizations and workers to visualize the structure of their goals (e.g., management hierarchy, concept-map, flowchart), prior research suggests the visualization approaches differ as one of the three types: hierarchical, network, and sequential models. Because a network model (vs. hierarchical and sequential models) highlights multiple connections between goals and reveals unobvious connections between them, we hypothesized that the use of a network goal model might increase people's ability to integrate seemingly unrelated ideas, even on subsequent unrelated tasks, leading to higher (convergent) creative performance. To test the hypothesis, we conducted an experiment in 2017 manipulating participants' goal models (hierarchical, network, sequential; N = 191, median age = 19) and measured their creativity. Results suggest that those in the network model condition performed better in the kind of creativity task that requires meaningful integration of unrelated ideas (i.e., convergent creativity); in contrast, there was no difference between goal model conditions on divergent creative performance. These findings thus illuminate how goal models may influence creativity, providing new insights into situational inductions that can boost creative performance. Theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and future directions of the work are discussed.","2018-10-29","2018-12-21 16:22:24","2018-12-21 16:22:24","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","creativity; goal models; goal regulation; goal structure; multiple goals; network model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this finding suggests dynamic pitch enhancement in target speech can benefit speech recognition in noise, it is of importance to know what noise characteristics affect dynamic pitch benefit, and who will benefit from enhanced dynamic pitch cues. Following our recent finding that temporal modulation in noise influences dynamic pitch benefit, we examined the effect of speech masker characteristics on dynamic pitch benefit. Specifically, the first goal of the study was to test the hypothesis that dynamic pitch benefit varies depending on the availability of pitch cues in the masker and the intelligibility of masker. The second goal of this study was to investigate whether older listeners as a group can benefit from dynamic pitch for speech recognition in speech maskers. In addition, individual factors of hearing loss and working memory capacity were examined for their impact on older listeners' dynamic pitch benefit. Twenty-three younger listeners with normal hearing and 37 older listeners with varying levels of hearing sensitivity participated the study, in which speech reception thresholds were measured with sentences in speech maskers. While we did not find an effect of masker characteristics on dynamic pitch benefit, the results showed older listeners can benefit from dynamic pitch for recognizing speech in speech maskers. The data also suggest that among those older listeners with hearing loss, dynamic pitch benefit is stronger for individuals with higher working memory capacity. This can be attributed to their ability to exploit facilitated lexical access in processing of degraded speech signal.","2018-10-22","2018-12-21 16:22:25","2018-12-21 16:22:25","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; cognition; hearing loss; pitch perception; speech recognition in noise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies have indicated an elevated frequency of left-handedness in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). However, there have been few studies explicitly exploring this relationship. The assumption is that the prevalence of left-handedness in individuals with DCD is higher compared with the prevalence in the general population and resembles the prevalence described in children with other developmental disorders. Computerized searches were conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo and CINAHL databases. Thirty-eight studies were identified and included in the present review, containing handedness distributions across 1071 persons with DCD and 1,045 controls. The distribution of DCD participants across handedness-categories was proved to be significantly different from that of the control group, with 14.7 and 8.1% left-handers, respectively. The prevalence of left-handedness within the DCD-group is lower than that reported for ASD, and larger than in dyslexia. The elevated levels of left-handedness within the different developmental disorders supports the notion of an association between the different diagnoses. However, the present results are not sufficient to conclude anything about a common cause or underlying factor via the male hormone testosterone. The present results could act as a starting point for testing the hypothesis of such a common factor, as one of the requirements is an elevated prevalence of left-handedness, and without such considerable doubt would be cast upon the hypothesis.","2018-10-18","2018-12-21 16:22:25","2018-12-21 16:22:25","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","clumsiness; dextrality; dyspraxia; hand dominance; laterality; preference; sinistrality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is presently unknown whether this simple technique has similar (or greater) effects on running performance. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to test the hypothesis that, compared with sham and cathodal tDCS, anodal tDCS applied over the M1 region would attenuate perception of effort, improve affective valence, and enhance exercise tolerance, regardless of changes in physiological responses, during maximal incremental exercise. In a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced design, 13 healthy recreational endurance runners, aged 20-42 years, volunteered to participate in this study. On three separate occasions, the subjects performed an incremental ramp exercise test from rest to volitional exhaustion on a motor-driven treadmill following 20-min of brain stimulation with either placebo tDCS (sham) or real tDCS (cathodal and anodal). Breath-by-breath pulmonary gas exchange and ventilation and indices of muscle hemodynamics and oxygenation were collected continuously during the ramp exercise test. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and affective valence in response to the ramp exercise test were also measured. Compared with sham, neither anodal tDCS nor cathodal tDCS altered the physiological responses to exercise (P > 0.05). Similarly, RPE and affective responses during the incremental ramp exercise test did not differ between the three experimental conditions at any time (P > 0.05). The exercise tolerance was also not significantly different following brain stimulation with either sham (533 +/- 46 s) or real tDCS (anodal tDCS: 530 +/- 44 s, and cathodal tDCS: 537 +/- 40 s; P > 0.05). These results demonstrate that acute tDCS applied over the M1 region did not after physiological responses, perceived exertion, affective valence, or exercise performance in recreational endurance runners.","2018-10-09","2018-12-21 16:22:25","2018-12-21 16:22:25","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affective valence; endurance performance; perception of effort; running; tDCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The NMDAR and GABAergic-interneuron functions may be indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN) and auditory steady-state gamma-band response (ASSR), respectively.

Psychological restoration can be provided by specific environments, in particular by natural environments. Studies report a restorative effect of nature on human beings, specifically in terms of the psychological recovery from attention fatigue and restored mental resources that were previously spent in activities that require attention. Two field studies in two Italian primary schools tested the hypothesized positive effect of recess time spent in a natural (vs. built) environment on pupils' cognitive performance and their perceived restorativeness, using standardized tests. In Study 1, children's psychological restoration was assessed by measuring sustained and selective attention, working memory, and impulse control, before and after the morning recess time. Team standardized playtime was conducted in a natural (vs. built) environment, and the perceived restorativeness was measured after each recess time. Results showed a greater increase in sustained and selective attention, concentration, and perceived restorativeness from pretest to posttest after the natural environment condition. In Study 2, the positive effect of free play recess time in a natural (vs. built) environment was assessed during the afternoon school time on sustained and selective attention and perceived restorativeness. Results showed an increase in sustained and selective attention after the natural environment condition (vs. built) and a decrease after the built environment break. Higher scores in perceived restorativeness were registered after the natural (vs. built) environment condition. Team standardized playtime and individual free play recess in a natural environment (vs. built) support pupils' attention restoration during both morning and afternoon school times, as well as their perceived restorativeness of the recess environment. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of nature's role both for the school ground design or redesign and for the organization of the school's activities.","2018-10-02","2018-12-21 16:22:27","2018-12-21 16:22:27","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attention; children; green areas; nature; restoration; school","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that the neural substrate underlying deontological guilt comprises brain regions strictly implicated in the emotion of disgust (i.e. the insula), the present study aimed to test the hypothesis that indirect stimulation of the insula via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would enhance disgust and morality in the deontological domain. A randomized, sham-controlled, within-subject design was used. Thirty-seven healthy individuals (25 women) under-went 15-min anodal and sham tDCS over T3 in two different days, while their heart rate (HR) was recorded to derive measures of parasympathetic nervous system activity (HR variability; HRV). After the first 10-min of sham or active tDCS stimulation, participants were asked to 1) complete a series of 6-item words that could be completed with either a disgust-related word (cleaning/dirtiness) or neutral alternatives; 2) rate how much a series of vignettes, each depicting a behavior that violated a specific moral foundation, were morally wrong. Levels of trait anxiety, depression, disgust sensitivity, scrupulosity, and altruism as well as pre- and post- stimulation momentary emotional states were assessed. Compared to the sham condition, after active stimulation of T3 a) HRV significantly increased and participants b) completed more words in terms of cleaning/dirtiness and c) reported greater subjective levels of disgust, all suggesting the elicitation of the emotion of disgust. Although the results are only marginally significant, they point to the absence of difference between the two experimental conditions for moral vignettes in the altruistic domain (i.e., animal care, emotional and physical human care), but not in the deontological domain (i.e., authority, fairness, liberty, and sacrality), where vignettes were judged as more morally wrong in the active compared to the sham condition. Moreover, scores on the OCI-R correlated with how much vignettes were evaluated as morally wrong in the deontological domain only. Results preliminarily support the association between disgust and morality in the deontological domain, with important implications for OC disorder (OCD). Future studies should explore the possibility of decreasing both disgust and morality in patients with OCD by the use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.","2018-10","2018-12-21 16:22:28","2018-12-21 16:22:28","","474-481","","","119","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Disgust; Heart rate variability; Insula; Morality; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Transcranial current direct stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current research challenges this notion. Among individuals who typically experience low positive affect (PA), vacillation between bouts of joy and marked anhedonia may be associated with better behavioral health relative to a restricted range of PA experience. We therefore tested the hypothesis that mean levels of PA captured via an 8-day intensive repeated Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) would moderate the association of EMA-measured PA variability with behavioral health measured at intake among working mothers (N = 202) with young children-a population at risk for experiencing repeated stress-and reward-induced PA changes. Mixed-effects location scale modeling parsed variance in PA mean and variability, which were used in subject-level regression models of associations with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and alcohol use. PA mean moderated the associations of PA variability with depressive symptoms (Interaction: beta = .20, p = .02) and alcohol consumption frequency (Interaction: beta = .22, p = .02). PA variability and depressive symptom and alcohol consumption levels were positively associated at higher PA mean levels, whereas PA variability was inversely associated with depressive symptom and alcohol consumption at low mean PA. PA Mean x Variability Interactions were not significant for anxiety and binge drinking. We conclude that (a) intensive longitudinal modeling of Affect Mean x Variability Interaction effects may provide incremental information in psychopathology research; (b) PA volatility does not unilaterally indicate poor behavioral health; and (c) a nuanced perspective on the role of PA volatility may benefit clinical services for working mothers. General Scientific Summary This study is one of the first to investigate the interactive association between mean levels and volatility in positive affect and mental health and health risk behaviors. Results indicate that considering of mean levels of positive affect may be important for understanding how variability in positive affect influences psychological and behavioral outcomes. This study adds to our theoretical understanding of the ways in which variability in positive affect can be adaptive for individuals with low mean levels of positive affect but maladaptive for individuals with high mean levels of positive affect.","2018-10","2018-12-21 16:22:28","2018-12-21 16:22:28","","639-649","","7","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol; depression; Ecological Momentary Assessment; mixed-effects location scale model; positive mood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The deficit of FMRP reported in idiopathic autism suggests a mechanistic overlap between FXS and autism. The overall goal of this study is to detect neuropathological commonalities of FMRP deficits in the brains of people with idiopathic autism and with syndromic autism caused by dup15q11.2-q13 (dup15). This study tests the hypothesis based on our preliminary data that both idiopathic and syndromic autism are associated with brain region-specific deficits of neuronal FMRP and structural changes of the affected neurons. This immunocytochemical study revealed neuronal FMRP deficits and shrinkage of deficient neurons in the cerebral cortex, subcortical structures, and cerebellum in subjects with idiopathic and dup(15)/autism. Neuronal FMRP deficit coexists with surprising infiltration of the brains of autistic children and adults with FMRP-positive astrocytes known to be typical only for the fetal and short postnatal periods. In the examined autistic subjects, these astrocytes selectively infiltrate the border between white and gray matter in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, the molecular layer of the cortex, part of the amygdala and thalamus, central cerebellar white matter, and dentate nucleus. Astrocyte pathology results in an additional local loss of FMRP in neurons and their shrinkage. Neuronal deficit of FMRP and shrinkage of affected neurons in structures free of FMRP-positive astrocytes and regions infiltrated with FMRP-expressing astrocytes appear to reflect mechanistic, neuropathological, and functional commonalities of FMRP abnormalities in FXS and autism spectrum disorder.

Current microscopic approaches consider the individual's behavior to predict the effect of individual actions in local interactions on the collective scale of the crowd motion. Recent developments in the use of virtual reality as an experimental tool have offered an opportunity to extend the understanding of these interactions in controlled and repeatable settings. Nevertheless, based on kinematics alone, it remains difficult to tease out how these interactions unfold. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that gaze activity provides additional information about pedestrian interactions. Using an eye tracker, we recorded the participant's gaze behavior whilst navigating through a virtual crowd. Results revealed that gaze was consistently attracted to virtual walkers with the smallest values of distance at closest approach (DCA) and time to closest approach (TtCA), indicating a higher risk of collision. Moreover, virtual walkers gazed upon before an avoidance maneuver was initiated had a high risk of collision and were typically avoided in the subsequent avoidance maneuver. We argue that humans navigate through crowds by selecting only few interactions and that gaze reveals how a walker prioritizes these interactions. Moreover, we pose that combining kinematic and gaze data provides new opportunities for studying how interactions are selected by pedestrians walking through crowded dynamic environments.","2018-10","2018-12-21 16:22:29","2018-12-21 16:22:29","","248-257","","","190","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Crowd navigation; Interaction neighborhood; Locomotion; Pareto optimality; Pedestrian; Virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We made the hypothesis that synchronizing self-displacement with that of a traffic gap shares the same perceptual-motor basis as interception tasks. While a large body of literature demonstrates that bearing angle is used to control interception, another range of studies points to optical size and expansion as playing a critical role in collision avoidance. In order to test the hypothesis of the exclusive use of bearing angle in road crossing task, we manipulated the optical size and expansion of oncoming traffic elements independently of bearing angle variations. We designed a driving simulator study in which participants were to adjust their approach speed in order to cross a road junction within a moving traffic gap. We manipulated the initial offset of participants with the traffic gap, the geometry of the road junction and the way optical size of oncoming traffic elements evolves over the course of a trial. Our results showed an effect of optical size and optical expansion manipulations eventhough, we also found similar displacement profiles as in interception studies. This demonstrates that bearing angle could not explain alone the control of such a complex perceptual-motor task. We discuss these results with regard to similar results in other fields of literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, national identity was expected to be defined in terms of “being,” “feeling,” and “doing.” The type of definition, and whether stopping being Mauritian is perceived as possible, was expected to depend on age and national identification. Possible differences by cultural group membership were explored. Method: The sample consisted of 2,190 adolescents of predominantly the three main cultural groups in Mauritius (Hindus, Muslims, and Creoles; M-age = 14.8 years, SDage = 1.7; 53% girls, 47% boys). Multiple correspondence and regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Results: The most important criterion mentioned for being Mauritian was respecting cultural diversity. Further, the criteria for national belonging could be clustered into being, feeling, and doing Mauritian. Older adolescents and higher national identifiers defined national belonging more in terms of feeling and less in terms of being than younger adolescents and lower national identifiers. In addition, they considered national identity to be less changeable. There were no clear differences between the three cultural groups. Conclusions: This study reveals the central importance of mutual respect and tolerance as the defining criterion for being Mauritian. Moreover, the feeling, being, and doing clusters of criteria provide a theoretically interesting distinction for understanding national belonging. It is recommended to test their possible correlates further and to use adult samples as well.","2018-10","2018-12-21 16:22:30","2018-12-21 16:22:30","","576-587","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; cultural diversity; identity; Mauritius; national belonging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key question concerns the role of attention in the interaction between perception-action processes. We tested the hypothesis that spatial attention is shared by perception and action. We created a dual-task paradigm: In one task, spatial information is relevant for perception (spatial-input task) but not for action, and in a second task, spatial information is relevant for action (spatial-output task) but not for perception. We used endogenous pre-cueing, with two between-subjects conditions: In one condition the cue was predictive only for the target location in the spatial-input task; in a second condition the cue was predictive only for the location of the response in the spatial-output task. In both conditions, the cueing equally affected both tasks, regardless of the information conveyed by the cue. This finding directly supports the shared input-output attention hypothesis.","2018-10","2018-12-21 16:22:30","2018-12-21 16:22:30","","1840-1846","","5","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Action; Endogenous attention; Perception; Pre-cueing; Spatial attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We analysed data on 11,037 participants aged 50+ from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Perceived social cohesion (PSC) of participants' neighbourhoods was assessed at baseline (2002/2003). Depressive symptoms were measured using CES-D scores (ranging from 0 to 8) on 7 occasions from baseline to 2014/2015. Trajectories of depressive symptoms by baseline PSC were estimated using latent growth modelling. Results At baseline, adults with low PSC had more depressive symptoms than age counterparts with high PSC. Consistent with the U-shaped trajectory of depressive symptoms by age, the association between PSC tertile and changes in depressive symptoms over follow-up was modified by age. Fifty-year-old participants with low PSC reported an average decrease in CES-D score from 0.66 to 0.54 during the 12-year follow up, compared to a change from 0.47 to 0.34 for age counterparts with high PSC. By contrast, in persons aged 85 at baseline, the mean CES-D score increased from 1.09 to 1.30 for participants with high PSC, while the rise was greater (from 1.49 to 2.03) among those with low PSC. The main effects and interaction of PSC with age were robust to adjustment for socio-economic and health characteristics. Conclusions Depressive symptom trajectories by PSC appear to widen as adults reach old age.","2018-10","2018-12-21 16:22:31","2018-12-21 16:22:31","","1081-1090","","10","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","CES-D; Depression; Latent growth modelling; Neighbourhood; Social cohesion; Trajectories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High levels of heteroplasmy at several mtDNA sites in complex I lead to inherited neurological neurologic diseases and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities. Here, we test the hypothesis that mtDNA heteroplasmy at these complex I sites is associated with depressive symptoms in the elderly. MethodsWe examined platelet mtDNA heteroplasmy for associations with depressive symptoms among 137 participants over age 70 from the community-based Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 10-point version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 10). Complete mtDNA sequencing was performed and heteroplasmy derived for 5 mtDNA sites associated with neurologic mitochondrial diseases and tested for associations with depressive symptoms. ResultsOf 5 candidate complex I mtDNA mutations examined for effects on depressive symptoms, increased heteroplasmy at m.13514A>G, ND5, was significantly associated with higher CES-D score (P=.01). A statistically significant interaction between m.13514A>G heteroplasmy and sex was detected (P=.04); in sex-stratified analyses, the impact of m.13514A>G heteroplasmy was stronger in male (P=.003) than in female (P=.98) participants.

Identifying the relevant clinical characteristics of youth with reactive aggression is an important first step in this process. Past research findings and theoretical formulations have suggested that deficits in both social skills and emotional regulation abilities are significantly associated with the development of reactive aggression in children. Utilizing a highly aggressive child inpatient sample (65 males and 36 females) receiving crisis-stabilization services, we tested the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation statistically mediated the relationship between theory of mind deficits and reactive aggression. As hypothesized, results of bootstrapped mediational analyses indicated that theory of mind deficits were associated with higher levels of reactive aggression via the indirect influence of dysregulated affect. These findings suggest that intervention programs for reactively aggressive children should promote both theory of mind skills and emotion regulation abilities. Children that develop more thoughtful styles of perspective taking coupled with an enhanced ability to modulate their emotions may develop a greater ability to employ the rational conflict resolution skills that underlie peaceful social relationships.","2018-10","2018-12-21 16:22:32","2018-12-21 16:22:32","","3385-3394","","10","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Child behavior problems; Child psychiatry; Emotion dysregulation; Reactive aggression; Theory of mind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, while some initial studies are suggestive, less is known about links between impulsivity and use of e-cigarettes or hookah tobacco. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the urgency and sensation seeking aspects of impulsivity would be prospectively associated with patterns of cigarette, e-cigarette, and hookah tobacco use over time. Young adults (n = 335; 56% male) aged 18-24 who were non- and never-daily cigarette smokers at baseline completed 9 online assessments of tobacco product use over two years. Longitudinal negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate relationships between impulsivity components and product use. Frequency of use of all three products declined over time. Higher levels of positive urgency (cigarette), negative urgency (hookah), and lack of premeditation (e-cigarette, hookah) were associated with smaller reductions in frequency of specific products. Additionally, higher negative urgency predicted greater quantity of cigarettes consumed, and higher sensation seeking was associated with more frequent e-cigarette use. Findings suggest impulsivity components differentially predict tobacco use over time, indicating that motives and/or risk factors for tobacco use may be product-specific.","2018-10","2018-12-21 16:22:33","2018-12-21 16:22:33","","153-157","","","85","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","E-cigarette; Hookah; Impulsivity; Tobacco","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analyses were conducted using a Mayo Clinic Bipolar Biobank cohort of 957 bipolar cases (including 333 with history of psychosis during mania, 64 with history of psychosis only during depression, 547 with no history of psychosis, and 13 with unknown history of psychosis) and 778 controls. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis was performed by calculating a SZ-PRS for the BD cases and controls, and comparing the calculated SZ risk between different psychosis subgroups and bipolar types. The SZ-PRS was significantly higher for BD-I cases with manic psychosis than BD-I cases with depressive psychosis (Nagelkerke's R-2 = 0.021; p = 0.045), BD-I cases without psychosis (R-2 = 0.015; p = 0.007), BD-II cases without psychosis (R-2 = 0.014; p = 0.017), and controls (R-2 = 0.065; p = 2 x 10(-13)).

Specifically, recent evidence from studies of divergent thinking suggests that kernel ideas emerge in posterior brain regions residing within the semantic system and/or the default mode network (DMN), and that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions within the executive control network (ECN) constrain those ideas for generating outputs that meet task demands. However, despite knowing that regions within these networks exhibit interaction, to date the direction of the relationship has not been tested directly. By applying Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to fMRI data collected during a divergent thinking task, we tested the hypothesis that the PFC exerts unidirectional control over the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), vs. the hypothesis that these two sets of regions exert bidirectional control over each other (in the form of feedback loops). The data were consistent with the former model by demonstrating that the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) exerts unidirectional control over MTG and IPL, although the evidence was somewhat stronger in the case of the MTG than the IPL. Our findings highlight potential causal pathways that could underlie the neural bases of divergent thinking.","2018-09","2018-12-21 16:22:34","2018-12-21 16:22:34","","68-78","","A","118","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Creativity; Divergent thinking; Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite being a key effect for models of selective attention, the magnitude of the effect varies considerably across studies. We report two within-subjects experiments that tested the hypothesis that presentation format modulates the magnitude of the response set effect. Trial types (e.g. response set, non response set, neutral) were either presented in separate blocks (pure) or in blocks containing trials from all conditions presented randomly (mixed). In the first experiment we show that the response set effect is substantially reduced in the mixed block context as a result of a decrease in RTs to response set trials. By demonstrating the modulation of the response set effect under conditions of trial type mixing we present evidence that is difficult for models of the effect based on strategic, top-down biasing of attention to explain. In a second experiment we tested a stimulus-driven account of the response set effect by manipulating the number of colour-words that make up the non-response set of distractors. The results show that the greater the number of non-response set colour concepts, the smaller the response set effect.

The underlying neural mechanisms are still a matter of debate. This study aimed at 1) reviewing the literature on the neural correlates of FTD in schizophrenia, and 2) testing the hypothesis that FTD correlates with structural and functional aberrations in the language network. Medline, PsychInfo, and Embasewere searched for neuroimaging studies, which applied a clinicalmeasure to assess FTD in adults with schizophrenia and were published in English or German in peer-reviewed journals until December 2016. Of 412 articles identified, 61 studies were included in the review. Volumetric studies reported bilateral grey matter deficits (L > R) to be associated with FTD in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobe. The same regions showed hyperactivity in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies and both hyper- and hypoactivity in fMRI studies that employed semantic processing or free speech production tasks. Diffusion tensor imaging studies demonstrated white matter aberrations in fibre tracts that connect the frontal and temporo-parietal regions. FTD in schizophrenia was found to be associated with structural and functional aberrations in the language network. However, there are studies that did not find an association between FTD and neural aberrations of the language network and regions not included in the language network have been associated with FTD. Thus, future research is needed to clarify the specificity of the language network for FTD in schizophrenia. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The association between maternal exposure to terror attacks during pregnancy and the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring was quantified with relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) fitting Cox regression models unadjusted and adjusted for confounders. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. The RR of schizophrenia in offspring of mothers exposed to terror attacks during pregnancy compared to offspring of mothers not exposed during pregnancy were estimated unadjusted (RR = 2.51, 95% CI, 1.33, 4.74) and adjusted (RR = 2.53, 95% CI, 1.63, 3.91). In the sensitivity analyses adjusted RRs were estimated using a sibling-based study design (2.85, 95% CI: 1.31-6.21) and propensity matching (2.45, 95% CI: 1.58-3.81). Maternal exposure to terror attacks during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in the offspring, possibly indicating a critical period of neurodevelopment that is sensitive to the stress of terror attacks and affected by epigenetic modifications.

Yet the factors that contribute to negative voice-content are still not well understood. This study aimed to test the hypotheses that levels of childhood adversity would predict levels of negative voice-content, and that negative voice-content would partially mediate a relation between childhood adversity and voice-related distress. These hypotheses were tested in a clinical sample of 61 patients with formally diagnosed psychotic disorders (48 schizophrenia, 13 bipolar). We found evidence consistent with negative voice-content fully (not partially) mediating the relation between childhood adversity and voice-related distress. Although bivariate analyses found depression to be associated with both negative voice-content and voice-related distress, we found no evidence of an indirect effect of childhood adversity on either negative voice-content or voice-related distress via depression. Alternative study designs are now needed to test if our findings are replicable and causal. Should they be, it will be necessary for psychological therapies to devise ways to reduce negative voice-content itself, rather than just changing beliefs about voices. A number of techniques are discussed (Avatar Therapy, Compassion Focused Therapy, voice-dialogue) that already show promise for this. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper reports the results of two studies testing the hypothesis that, in France, the cultural norm of new laicite (a French-specific ideology of secularism) can moderate the impact of the perceived host culture adoption and national identification on discrimination against immigrants. We conducted a correlational study (Study 1, N=249) and an experiment (Study 2, N=143) using two distinct and previously validated measures of intergroup discrimination. Results showed that the higher the perception of a norm of new laicite, the stronger the link between host culture adoption and national identification. More specifically, among native French people, the perception of a weak host culture adoption and a weak national identification on the part of immigrants produced higher levels of discriminatory behavior especially when the intergroup norm of new laicite was high. These studies highlight the fundamental importance of taking into account culture-specific variables in the study of discrimination and point to the fact that, by changing the normative context, one may change intergroup behaviors. Reducing intergroup discrimination in applied settings may require targeting culture-specific intergroup norms.","2018-09","2018-12-21 16:22:37","2018-12-21 16:22:37","","506-518","","9","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Older adults are less effective in maintaining an attentional bias in favor of goal-relevant information and are less flexible in shifting control relative to younger adults. Using a novel variant of the Stroop color-naming task, we tested the hypothesis that age-related differences in the flexible shifting of control may be small or absent when control is guided by experience (i.e., environmental input guiding attention). Younger and older adults named the color of color words in abbreviated lists of trials. In Experiment 1, experience within the early segment of the list was manipulated to encourage adoption of more (mostly congruent condition) or less (mostly incongruent condition) attention toward the word. More important, the middle and late portions were 50% congruent in both conditions. Older adults, like younger adults, demonstrated flexible acquisition and shifting of control settings (i.e., relative attention to word vs. color information). In Experiment 2 we replicated this finding. Additionally, we found that both age groups flexibly acquired and shifted control settings for “transfer” items (i.e., items that were 50% congruent in all lists and list segments), pointing to a generalizable (i.e., global) form of control rather than an item-specific mechanism. Discussion focuses on the role of experience-guided control in enabling flexible performance in older adults.","2018-09","2018-12-21 16:22:37","2018-12-21 16:22:37","","924-939","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive control; experience-guided control; proportion congruent; statistical learning; Stroop","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample consisted of 36 hospitalized patients (25 men, 11 women) with the first episode or long-term course of schizophrenia. The severity of psychopathology was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Samples for measurement of serum aldosterone were obtained immediately after awakening. The results showed that serum aldosterone concentrations were lower in patients with the first episode compared to those in patients with long-term course of schizophrenia. Importantly, lower aldosterone concentrations observed in patients with the first episode were associated with more severe clinical symptoms as indicated by all subscales of PANSS. Serum cortisol concentrations did not differ between the groups, while the aldosterone/cortisol ratio showed similar pattern as aldosterone concentrations.

Asian Americans represent the fastest growing racial/ethnic cohort in the United States, yet they continue to face oppression and racism. Although extensive research has examined the impact of intergroup contact and individual difference variables on negative attitudes toward minority groups, much less research has examined factors impacting positive outgroup (or allophilic) attitudes. Furthermore, recent research has documented that narrow personality traits (e.g., multicultural personality) are superior to broad traits (e.g., Big Five) in predicting attitudes and behavior in multicultural contexts. The authors hypothesized that the quantity and quality of contact with Asian Americans would mediate the direct relationship between multicultural personality and allophilic attitudes toward Asian Americans. A sample of 876 undergraduate students (M-age = 19.5 years, 69.4% female, 79% White) were recruited for structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. Results largely supported the hypotheses, suggesting that quality and quantity of intergroup contact mediate the relationship between multicultural personality and allophilia. Further, using the newer procedure of exploratory structural equation modeling, the authors identified a bifactor model with a strong general factor undergirding the Multicultural Personality Inventory. Positive attitudes toward Asian Americans are predicted by multicultural personality and mediated by intergroup contact quality and quantity.","2018-09","2018-12-21 16:22:38","2018-12-21 16:22:38","","200-210","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","allophilia; Asian American; exploratory structural equation modeling; intergroup contact; multicultural personality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study tested the novel hypothesis that non-numerical ordering ability, as measured by the ordering of familiar sequences of events, also plays an important role in maths development. Ninety children were tested in their first school year and 87 were followed up at the end of their second school year, to test the hypothesis that ordinal processing, including the ordering of non-numerical materials, would be related to their maths skills both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The results confirmed this hypothesis. Ordinal processing measures were significantly related to maths both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and children's non-numerical ordering ability in their first year of school (as measured by order judgements for everyday events and the parents' report of their child's everyday ordering ability) was the strongest longitudinal predictor of maths one year later, when compared to several measures that are traditionally considered to be important predictors of early maths development. Children's everyday ordering ability, as reported by parents, also significantly predicted growth in formal maths ability between Year 1 and Year 2, although this was not the case for the event ordering task. The present study provides strong evidence that domain-general ordering abilities play an important role in the development of children's maths skills at the beginning of formal education.","2018-09","2018-12-21 16:22:38","2018-12-21 16:22:38","","","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that theory-based e-mail boosters would promote maintenance of change after a BMI. Method: Participants were students (N = 568; 72% male) who violated campus alcohol policy and were mandated to participate in an alcohol-risk-reduction program. Participants provided baseline data, received a BMI, and then completed a 1-month post-BMI survey. Next, they were randomized to receive 12 booster e-mails that contained either (a) alcohol norms or (b) structurally equivalent general health information (control). Alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences were assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 12 months. Results: As expected, we observed significant reductions in both consumption and consequences after the BMI (ps<.01), and groups were equivalent at baseline and at 1-month post-BMI, prior to randomization (ps>.05). Latent growth curve models revealed no condition effects on changes in the latent consumption variable from 1-to 12-month follow-ups (b=.01, SE=.01, p>.05). Unexpectedly, a main effect of the condition emerged for self-reported consequences (b=.03, SE=.01, p=.01); we observed more consequences after boosters containing alcohol norms than general health information. Outcomes were not moderated by sex, consumption at baseline or 1 month, or e-mail exposure, and there was no mediation by descriptive norms, injunctive norms, or peer communication.

Low levels of authentic pride may signal that changes in effort or behavior are needed. Prior work has focused on stable individual differences in pride rather than fluctuations in pride as people pursue their goals. The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that achievement is associated with authentic pride and that fluctuations in authentic pride predict changes in training behaviors as evidenced by fluctuations in subsequent training progress. Design: This study used a longitudinal design with repeated weekly online diaries and multilevel modelling to test study objectives. Method: Participants training for a long-distance race (N = 131, 78% women; M = 35.4 years) provided weekly self-reports on pride and training progress for seven weeks. Results: Multilevel models indicated that training progress predicted authentic pride at both the within(b = 0.43, p < .001) and between-person level (b = 0.53, p < .001). When participants reported lower authentic pride than usual on a given week, training progress increased the following week (b = -0.31, p < .001). Conversely, greater authentic pride was associated with greater training progress on average (b = 0.21, p < .001). Conclusions: Consistent with control-process accounts, runners may use their feelings of pride to regulate their behavior. Low feelings of pride can be adaptive for goal striving by signaling when strategies or efforts need to be adjusted.","2018-09","2018-12-21 16:22:40","2018-12-21 16:22:40","","10-16","","","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Affect; Emotion; Exercise; Goal striving; Multilevel modelling; Sport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, we empirically observed that a lot of enterprises selling fruits online have suffered from bankruptcy due to a lot of complicated factors, such as inefficient logistics, low acceptance of online platforms, and financial risks. One of the root causes responsible for such an unanticipated phenomenon is related to the purchase intention, which motivates us to investigate what are the dominant factors affecting the online purchase intention of fruits. The results can be of great significance to the development of fruit e-commerce enterprises in online marketing. Based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and perceived risk theory (PRT), this research developed an integrated theoretical model to explore the influential factors underlying consumers' intention to purchase fruits online. A web-based survey of 344 consumers with ages below 30 was used to test the hypotheses in our theoretical model. Through sample collection with questionnaires, a structural equation model is developed to compute the coupling relationship between influential factors and purchase intention. The results reveal that fruit quality and price are dominantly affecting the willingness of consumers to purchase fruit. Surprisingly, we found that e-commerce platforms, information quality, and perceived risk are less significant. Finally, some specific suggestions are recommended for fruit e-commerce enterprises in devising effective marketing strategies.","2018-08-23","2018-12-21 16:22:41","2018-12-21 16:22:41","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","fruit e-commerce; online purchase intention; perceived risk theory; structural equation model; technology acceptance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our first goal was to test the hypothesis that men, relative to women, are less interested in pursuing HEED careers in part because they are less likely than women to endorse communal values. A second, more novel goal was to extend goal congruity theory to examine whether gender differences in communal values also predict the belief that HEED careers add worth to society and are deserving of higher salaries. In three studies of undergraduate students (total N = 979), we tested the predictive role of communal values (i.e., a focus on caring for others), as distinct from agentic values (i.e., a focus on status, competition, and wealth; Bakan, 1966). Consistent with goal congruity theory, Studies 1 and 2 revealed that men's lower interest in adopting HEED careers, such as nursing and elementary education, was partially mediated by men's (compared to women's) lower communal values. Extending the theory, all three studies also documented a general tendency to see HEED as having relatively lower worth to society compared to STEM careers. As expected, communal values predicted perceiving higher societal worth in HEED careers, as well as supporting increases in HEED salaries. Thus, gender differences in communal values accounted for men's (compared to women's) tendency to perceive HEED careers as having less societal worth and less deserving of salary increases. In turn, gender differences in perceived societal worth of HEED itself predicted men's relatively lower interest in pursuing HEED careers. In no instance, did agentic values better explain the gender difference in HEED interest or perceived worth. These findings have important implications for how we understand the value that society places on occupations typically occupied by women versus men.","2018-08-10","2018-12-21 16:22:41","2018-12-21 16:22:41","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agentic values; career choice; career evaluations; career status; communal values; gender differences; occupational interest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the exact processes whereby perfectionism may influence sleep have as yet remained unexplored. The present study tested the hypothesis that perfectionistic individuals are particularly prone to engage in counterfactual thinking and to experience counterfactual emotions (regret, shame, and guilt) at bedtime, which have been shown to impair sleep. One hundred eighty university students completed questionnaires on perfectionism, counterfactual processing, and insomnia severity. Analyses revealed that three dimensions of perfectionism were significantly related to insomnia severity: Concern over mistakes and doubts about action showed positive correlations, whereas organization showed a negative correlation. Moreover, the frequency of counterfactual thoughts and emotions at bedtime largely mediated the effects of these dimensions of perfectionism on insomnia severity. These findings highlight how personality-related patterns of behavior may translate into affective arousal at bedtime, thereby increasing the risk of insomnia.","2018-08-07","2018-12-21 16:22:42","2018-12-21 16:22:42","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affect; counterfactual emotion; counterfactual thinking; insomnia; perfectionism; personality; sleep disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies demonstrated that patients with TRS or NTRS exhibited abnormal neural activity in different brain regions. Accordingly, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach could be used to distinguish between patients with TRS and NTRS. Methods: A total of 17 patients with TRS, 17 patients with NTRS, and 29 healthy controls (HCs) matched in sex, age, and education levels were recruited to undergo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). ReHo was used to process the data. ANCOVA followed by post-hoc t-tests, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), and correlation analyses were applied for the data analysis. Results: ANCOVA analysis revealed widespread differences in ReHo among the three groups in the occipital, frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. ROC results indicated that the optimal sensitivity and specificity of the ReHo values in the left postcentral gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus/triangular part, and right fusiform could differentiate TRS from NTRS, TRS from HCs, and NTRS from HCs were 94.12 and 82.35%, 100 and 86.21%, and 82.35 and 93.10%, respectively. No correlation was found between abnormal ReHo and clinical symptoms in patients with TRS or NTRS. Conclusions: TRS and NTRS shared most brain regions with abnormal neural activity. Abnormal ReHo values in certain brain regions might be applied to differentiate TRS from NTRS, TRS from HC, and NTRS from HC with high sensitivity and specificity.","2018-08-06","2018-12-21 16:22:42","2018-12-21 16:22:42","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","function magnetic resonance imaging; left inferior frontal gyrus; left postcentral gyrus; non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia; regional homogeneity; right fusiform; treatment-resistant schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inferences assist us to simplify perception highlighting what can be predicted on the basis of prior learning (through the formation of internal “prediction” Models) and what might be new, potentially necessitating an investment of resources to remodel predictions. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that sound sequences with multiple levels of predictability may rely on cognitive resources and be cognitively penetrable to a greater extent than was previously shown by studies presenting simpler sound sequences. Auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded from 117 participants. All participants heard the exact same sound sequence but under different conditions: 51 while watching a DVD movie and 66 while performing a cognitively demanding task. Participants were asked to ignore the sounds and focus their attention on the movie/task. However, prior to commencing the experiment we manipulated what participants knew about the sound sequence by providing explicit sequence information to 15 and 34 of the participants in the DVD and cognitive-task conditions, respectively, and no information to the others. The results demonstrated that although local pattern violations elicited distinctive AEP responses (namely, mismatch negativity), the way the amplitude of this response was modulated by sequence learning over time was dependent upon both task and explicit sequence knowledge. The implications are discussed with reference to how the division of available attention resources between the primary task and concurrent sound impacts what is learned.","2018-08","2018-12-21 16:22:43","2018-12-21 16:22:43","","379-388","","","117","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention; Auditory inference; Learning; Mismatch negativity; Predictive processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The predictive effect of prosociality on subsequent arts engagement is significantly weaker. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the arts provide an important vehicle for facilitating a cohesive and sustainable society.

It is also known that muscle damage is reduced when maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) are performed at a long muscle length 2-4 days prior to maximal eccentric exercise with the same muscle, a phenomenon that can be described as isometric preconditioning (IPC). We tested the hypothesis that IPC could attenuate muscle damage and changes in RE following downhill running. Thirty untrained men were randomly assigned into experimental or control groups and ran downhill on a treadmill (- 15%) for 30 min. Participants in the experimental group completed 10 MVIC in a leg press machine two days prior to downhill running, while participants in the control group did not perform IPC. The magnitude of changes in muscle soreness determined 48 h after downhill running was greater for the control group (122 +/- 28 mm) than for the experimental group (92 +/- 38 mm). Isometric peak torque recovered faster in the experimental group compared with the control group (3 days vs. no full recovery, respectively). No significant effect of IPC was found for countermovement jump height, serum creatine kinase activity or any parameters associated with RE. These results supported the hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in markers of muscle damage. The hypothesis that IPC attenuates changes in RE was not supported by our data. It appears that the mechanisms involved in changes in markers of muscle damage and parameters associated with RE following downhill running are not completely shared.","2018-08","2018-12-21 16:22:44","2018-12-21 16:22:44","","1-9","","","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decline running; Eccentric exercise; Exercise prophylaxis; Maximal voluntary contractions; Myofibrilar disruption; Running efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that maternal early life stress, psychiatric diagnoses, anxiety, perceived stress, and socioeconomic status influence BDNF and glucocorticoid concentrations in amniotic fluid in the second trimester. We studied 79 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis in the early second trimester and analyzed BDNF, cortisol, and cortisone concentrations in amniotic fluid.

Low family income (socioeconomic status) was related to high amniotic fluid glucocorticoid concentrations.

Drawing on instrumental and relational perspectives of justice, we test the hypothesis that the perception of procedural justice influences the level of workers' psychological distress. Using a number of validated instruments to collect data from 659 workers in 3 call centers, we use OLS regressions and Hayes' PROCESS tool to show that the perception of procedural justice has a direct, unique, and independent effect on psychological distress. The perception of procedural justice has no instrumental role, the key mechanism being the relational role, suggesting that perceived injustice influences psychological distress because it threatens self-esteem. Distributive justice perceptions (recognition, promotions, job security) are not associated with psychological distress, calling into question Siegrist's model. Our findings suggest that perceived procedural justice provides workers better evidence of the extent to which they are valued and appreciated members of their organizations than do perceptions of distributive justice. The results highlight the greater need for workers to be valued and appreciated for who they are (consideration and esteem), rather than for what they do for their organization (distributive justice of rewards).","2018-08","2018-12-21 16:22:45","2018-12-21 16:22:45","","283-300","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","consideration and esteem; job design; mental health; organizational justice; psychological distress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Five experiments tested the hypothesis that the tactile experience of warmth can satisfy a person's acutely active desire for social affiliation. Across 5 experiments, the tactile experience of warmth (vs. control temperatures) reduced outcomes that would otherwise be aimed at restoring a person's level of social affiliation, but this effect was observed only among people who had just been excluded (not those undergoing a control procedure) and only among people low in fear of negative evaluation-those people known to experience strongly activated affiliative motives following exclusion. Findings suggest that warmth-a sensation signaling the proximity of a close relationship partner-satisfies currently active affiliative motives.

They used reproductions of cubist pictures of different abstractness as stimuli, which was assumed to modulate processing fluency. As a result, less abstract pictures were not only processed more fluently and preferred, they also produced larger PDs than more abstract ones. This was interpreted as support of their hypothesis. The aim of the present study was to replicate and generalize these results with an improved method and by adding expressionist pictures, which covered a relatively large range of abstractness. In the first experiment, where art style was blocked, there were no clear results. Therefore, the authors randomized art style in the second experiment. This time PDs increased with decreasing abstractness, even though significantly only for the expressionist pictures. However, there was no relation between preference and PDs. Thus, although they also observed a covariation between abstractness and pupil size, the data do not support the idea that PDs reflect fluency-induced aesthetic affect.","2018-08","2018-12-21 16:22:46","2018-12-21 16:22:46","","294-303","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aesthetic preference; emotion; processing fluency; pupil size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that disconfirmed predictions elicit a post-N400-positivity (PNP) with two distinct distributions. A frontal-PNP (f-PNP) is elicited when an unexpected but congruent word appears instead of a highly predictable word. whereas an anomalous word elicits a posterior-PNP. The current study tested the hypothesis that during the processing of a sentence, the predicted word is inhibited to enable the integration of unexpected but congruent material, and that this inhibitory process is reflected in the f-PNP component. In contrast, anomalous continuations, which are not compatible with the preceding context, do not induce inhibition. Experiment 1 used cross-modal lexical priming to test inhibition patterns of predicted words, demonstrating inhibition when integration of a congruent-unexpected word was needed, but not when an anomaly was encountered. Experiment 2 showed that the inhibition observed in Experiment 1 is specific to the predicted word and does not stem from competition between two congruent continuations. In Experiment 3 we recorded ERPs using the same materials, and found that the f-PNP component is elicited under the same conditions giving rise to behavioral inhibition, and that the two are correlated, thus providing preliminary support for the hypothesis that this component reflects an inhibitory process.","2018-08","2018-12-21 16:22:46","2018-12-21 16:22:46","","1269-1285","","8","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","event-related potentials; inhibition; PNP; prediction; sentence processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper seeks to theorize on and examine the etiology of such symptoms. Relying on the dual system theory (DST) with a specific focus on social aspects, this manuscript develops a research model positing that the momentary experience of SNS addiction symptoms is driven by tug-of-war between social self-regulation (a reflective process) and habit (a reflexive process), the effect of which is mediated via SNS use. It then tests the hypotheses through analyzing survey data from 161 SNS users, using structural equation modeling techniques. Results support the dual system perspective we take. They show that (1) habit (a reflexive system manifestation) drives SNS use and the experience of addiction symptoms, (2) social self-regulation (a reflective system manifestation) inhibits use and the experience of addiction symptoms and, (3) dual system effects on momentary SNS addiction symptoms are mediated through SNS use. This study introduces and validates a model that explains the experience of momentary SNS addiction symptoms. In particular, the proposed model extends prior dual system models by examining an overlooked, yet important, reflective process (social self-regulation) in the context of SNS use; and by focusing on an important, prevalent, yet relatively disregarded outcome (momentary symptoms rather than full-fledged addiction). The findings point to interesting theoretical and practical implications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We leveraged intensive experience sampling methods to test the hypothesis that craving recorded at drinking and non-drinking moments would mediate naltrexone effects on the likelihood of heavy drinking, but only among carriers of the DRD4 long (DRD4-L) allele. Methods: Participants (M-age = 29.8 years, SD = 12.1) were non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers (n = 104, 54.8% female, 61.5% alcohol dependent) randomized to 3 weeks of daily naltrexone (50 mg) or placebo. During these 3 weeks, participants used handheld electronic devices to complete real-time reports of alcohol use and craving multiple times per day in their natural environments. This approach afforded intensive repeated assessment of focal variables and provided in-the-moment data to test whether craving when not drinking or early in drinking episodes explained naltrexone effects on drinking. Results: Moderated-mediation multilevel structural equation models showed that craving during non-drinking moments mediated the treatment effect of naltrexone on heavy drinking but only among carriers of the DRD4-L allele. The same pattern of associations was not shown when evaluating craving while participants were consuming alcoholic beverages. Conclusions: Findings provide the first in vivo evidence that, among carriers of the DRD4-L allele, naltrexone blunts craving in real-world settings, and this effect in turn reduces the likelihood of heavy drinking. This work highlights the utility of EMA methods for elucidating how treatments work and further demonstrates the importance of genetic factors for understanding individual differences in pharmacotherapy responsiveness.","2018-08","2018-12-21 16:22:47","2018-12-21 16:22:47","","72-78","","SI","83","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alcohol; Craving; Ecological momentary assessment; Genetic; Naltrexone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that this pattern emerges because an understanding of cardinal value jump starts children's learning of the relations among numerals. Across two years of preschool, the cardinal knowledge of 179 children (85 boys) was assessed four times, as was their understanding of the relative quantity of Arabic numerals and competence at discriminating nonsymbolic quantities. Children were more accurate on nonsymbolic than numeral comparisons before they understood cardinality, but showed more rapid growth for numeral than nonsymbolic comparisons once they understood cardinality. Moreover, and with the possible exception of very small numerals (< 5), before they understood cardinality children were no better than chance in their numeral comparisons, but greatly exceeded chance once they understood cardinality. These patterns were independent of the age at which children became cardinal principle knowers and independent of intelligence, executive function, and preliteracy skills.

Aims: The primary aim was to test the hypothesis that the response rate to ECT for depression and psychosis is higher during the postpartum period than outside this period. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of a response to ECT during the postpartum period. Materials and methods: Cases with postpartum depression and/or psychosis received ECT within 6 months of delivery. A matched comparison group with depression and/or psychosis (not within the postpartum period) was identified from the Swedish National Quality Register for ECT. The improvement 1 week after ECT was classified according to the Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Improvement scale (CGI-I) as responder (CGI-I score 1-2) or non-responder (CGI-I score 3-7). Results: 185 cases and 185 comparison group subjects were included (46% with psychosis in each groups). More cases (87.0%) than comparison group subjects (73.5%) responded to ECT (p = 0.001). Adjusted binary regression analysis revealed that more severe symptoms prior to treatment were the only statistically significant predictor of response. Limitations: There was no control group without ECT treatment. Conclusion: The response rate of those with postpartum depression and/or psychosis to ECT was high. The response rate of patients with psychosis or depression was higher during the postpartum period than outside it. This study supports the use of ECT for severe forms of postpartum depression and/or psychosis.","2018-08-01","2018-12-21 16:22:48","2018-12-21 16:22:48","","258-264","","","235","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Electroconvulsive therapy treatment outcome; Postpartum depression; Postpartum psychosis; Puerperal disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study tested the hypothesis that combat exposure has a significant indirect effect on suicidal behavior among Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans through its effects on PTSD-depressive symptomatology. Methods: Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans (N=3,238) participated in a cross-sectional, multi-site study of post deployment mental health consisting of clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine direct and indirect relationships between three latent variables: combat exposure, PTSD-depression, and suicidal behavior (past attempts and current ideation, intent, and preparation). Results: A partial mediation model was the best-fitting model for the data. Combat exposure was significantly associated with PTSD-depression (beta=0.50, p<.001), which was in turn associated with suicidal behavior(beta=0.62, p<.001). As expected, the indirect effect between combat exposure and suicidal behavior was statistically significant, beta=0.31, p<.001. Limitations: Data were cross-sectional, and suicidal behavior was measured via self-report. Conclusions: Results indicated that combat exposure was indirectly related to suicidal behavior via PTSD-depressive symptomatology. Findings lend support for a higher-order combined PTSD-depression latent factor and suggest that Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans with high levels of PTSD-depressive symptoms are at increased risk for suicidal behavior.","2018-08-01","2018-12-21 16:22:49","2018-12-21 16:22:49","","407-413","","","235","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Combat exposure; Depression; PTSD; Suicide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Study With the MMPI-2-RF","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01064","","Background and Purpose: Research on the relationship between response latency (RL) and faking in self-administered testing scenarios have generated contradictory findings. We explored this relationship further, aiming to add further insight into the reliability of self-report measures. We compared RLs and T-scores on the MMPI-2RF (validity and restructured clinical [RC] scales) in four experimental groups. Our hypotheses were that: the Fake-Good Speeded group would obtain a different completion time; show higher RLs than the Honesty Speeded Group in the validity scales; show higher T-Scores in the L-r and K-r scales and lower T-scores in the F-r and RC scales; and show higher levels of tension and fatigue. Finally, the impact of the speeded condition in malingering was assessed. Materials and Methods: The sample was comprised of 135 subjects (M = 26.64; SD = 1.88 years old), all of whom were graduates (having completed at least 17 years of instruction), male, and Caucasian. Subjects were randomly assigned to four groups: Honesty Speeded, Fake-Good Speeded, Honesty Un-Speeded, and Fake-Good UnSpeeded. A software version of the MMPI-2-RF and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were administered. To test the hypotheses, MANOVAs and binomial logistic regressions were run. Results: Significant differences were found between the four groups, and particularly between the Honest and Fake-Good groups in terms of test completion time and the L-r and K-r scales. The speeded condition increased T-scores in the L-r and K-r scales but decreased T-scores in some of the RC scales. The Fake groups also scored higher on the VAS Tension subscale. Completion times for the first and second parts of the MMPI-2-RF and T-scores for the K-r scale seemed to predict malingering. Conclusion: The speeded condition seemed to bring out the malingerers.

Increasing evidence suggests greater empathy for racial in-group than out-group individuals' pain and the racial in-group bias undergoes sociocultural and biological influences. The present study further investigated whether and how physical environments influence racial in-group bias in empathy by testing the hypothesis that sensory experiences of physical coldness versus warmth enhance differential empathic neural responses to racial ingroup vs. out-group individuals' suffering. We recorded event-related brain potentials to painful versus neutral expressions of same-race and other-race faces when participants held a cold or warm pack. We found that brain activity in the N2 (200-340 ms) and P3 (400-600 ms) time windows over the frontal/central region was positively shifted by painful (vs. neutral) expressions. Moreover, the N2/P3 empathic neural responses were significantly larger for same-race than other-race faces in the cold but not in the warm condition. Moreover, subjective ratings of different temperatures in the cold vs. warm conditions predicted larger changes of racial ingroup bias in empathic neural responses in the N2 time window.

Analyses of variance showed significant differences between patients and controls in inhibition and planning (p = .001 and .001), and phonological fluency (p = .004). The poorer performance in phonological fluency of the children with SCD was not associated with any visible brain damage to language areas. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that, whereas the control children's vocabulary knowledge explained their performance in the phonological fluency tasks, only inhibition skills accounted for variance in the performance of the children with SCD.

Methods: Prospective observational cohort of cardiac arrest patients admitted between 9/2015-5/2017. Survival to discharge with sufficient mental status to complete a psychosocial interview was the main inclusion criterion. Perceived recovery was assessed through the question, “Do you feel that you have made a complete recovery from your arrest?” The following measures were examined as potential correlates of perceived recovery: Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, Modified Lawton Physical Self-Maintenance Scale, Barthel Index, Modified Rankin Scale, Cerebral Performance Category, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D), and PTSD Checklist-Specific (PCL-S).

An inflammatory state might be one mechanism linking PTSS with poor prognosis after ACS. We tested the hypothesis that a change in C-reactive protein (CRP) between hospital admission and 3-month follow-up is an independent predictor of ACS-triggered PTSS. Methods: We assessed 183 patients (median age 59 years; 84% men) with verified myocardial infarction (MI) within 48 h of an acute coronary intervention and three months post-MI for self-rated PTSS. 14 (7.7%) patients fulfilled definition criteria for PTSS caseness. CRP values were categorized according to the predicted risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at hospital admission (acute inflammatory response): 0 to < 5 mg/L, 5 to < 10 mg/L, 10 to < 20 mg/L, and >= 20 mg/L; and at 3-month follow-up (low-grade inflammation): 0 to < 1 mg/L, 1 to < 3 mg/L, and >= 3 mg/L. Additionally, in a subsample of 84 patients with CRP levels below 20 mg/L at admission, CRP values were log-transformed. Results: After adjustment for covariates, less of a reduction or an increase of log CRP values between admission and 3-month follow-up predicted PTSS caseness (OR 6.25, 95% CI 1.25, 31.38), and continuous PTSS (unstandardized B = 0.21, 95% CI 0.07, 4.19; p = 0.043). Less reduction in CRP risk categories predicted both PTSS caseness (OR 4.14, 95% CI 1.89, 9.06) and continuous PTSS (B = 1.80, 95% CI 1.09, 2.51; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Persistently heightened inflammation seems to be predictive for the development of PTSS three months after ACS, so interventions to lower inflammation might be warranted.","2018-08","2018-12-21 16:22:51","2018-12-21 16:22:51","","125-130","","","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cardiovascular disease; Inflammation; Psychobiology; Risk factor; Trauma stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although MEP amplitude is primarily associated with motor system function, there is evidence that nonmotor factors may also influence amplitude. This experiment tested the hypotheses that manipulation of 2 factors (visual attention, cognitive regulation) in human participants would significantly affect MEP amplitude.Methods:Blocks of MEPs were recorded from the dominant right hand as participants (N = 20) were instructed to shift their visual attention (toward and away from the hand) and cognitively regulate the MEPs (rest, attenuate MEP amplitude, potentiate MEP amplitude) using their thoughts (6 blocks, 20 pulses/block, randomized, 110% resting motor threshold). Results:MEP amplitude was significantly affected by the direction of visual attention; looking away from the hand led to higher amplitudes (P = 0.003). The relationship with cognitive regulation was nonsignificant. Conclusions:The significant effect of visual attention on MEP suggests that this should be a standardized parameter in clinical and research studies. These data underscore the importance of rigorous reporting of methods and use of standardized practices for MEP acquisition and TMS dosing to ensure consistent clinical measurement and treatment.","2018-07","2018-12-21 16:22:51","2018-12-21 16:22:51","","220-229","","4","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive regulation; motor-evoked potentials; procedure standardization; resting motor threshold; transcranial magnetic stimulation; visual attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the hypothesis that GBR12909 injection impairs habituation and induces hyperlocomotion in mice, along with changes in cytokines and neurotrophic factors levels, as observed in BD patients. We also tested if lithium carbonate, sodium valproate and aripiprazole prevent GBR12909-induced locomotion. Male Swiss mice received GBR12909 (15 mg/kg) injections and locomotor responses were quantified in an open field. Cytokines and neurotrophic factors levels were assessed in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus 30 min and 24 h after injections. Pre-treatments with lithium, valproate or aripiprazole were performed with single and repeated injection protocols. GBR12909 prevented motoric habituation and increased basal locomotion in habituated mice in the open field. This compound also induced changes in IL-2 and BDNF levels in prefrontal cortex; IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 in striatum; and IL-10, IL-4, IFN-gamma and NGF in hippocampus. GBR12909-induced hyperlocomotion was attenuated by lithium (12.5-100 mg/kg), but not valproate (75-300 mg/kg), and prevented by aripiprazole (0.1-10 mg/kg). Repeated injections of these drugs (twice a day for 3 days), however, failed to inhibit hyperlocomotion. The main limitations of the protocols in this study are the analysis of locomotion as the only behavioral parameter, changes in immune factors that may overlap with other psychiatric disorders and the lack chronic drug injections. Despite of these limitations, this study adds to previous literature suggesting DAT inhibition as a potential animal model of mania related to BD.","2018-07","2018-12-21 16:22:52","2018-12-21 16:22:52","","142-149","","","102","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Aripiprazole; Bipolar disorder; Dopamine; GBR12909; Lithium; Valproate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Marathon runners (n = 224, female n = 81, M age = 39.77 years, SD = 9.50 years) completed measures capturing four subtypes of perfectionism (pure self oriented perfectionism, pure socially prescribed perfectionism, mixed perfectionism, and non-perfectionism) and strategies for coping with injury (problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and avoidance coping). Moderated regression analyses provided support for all four hypotheses of the 2 x 2 model for problem-focused coping, one hypothesis for emotion-focused coping, and none for avoidance-coping. Problem-focused coping was highest for pure self-oriented perfectionism and lowest for pure socially prescribed perfectionism. Emotion focused coping was higher for pure self-oriented perfectionism compared to non-perfectionism. Finally, avoidance coping was similar across all subtypes.

Individual differences in EF skills early in life are predictive of quality-of-life outcomes 30 years later (Moffitt etal., 2011). What changes in the brain give rise to this critical cognitive ability? Traditionally, frontal cortex growth is thought to underlie changes in cognitive control (Bunge & Zelazo, 2006; Moriguchi & Hiraki, 2009). However, more recent data highlight the importance of long-range cortical interactions between frontal and posterior brain regions. Here, we test the hypothesis that developmental changes in EF skills reflect changes in how posterior and frontal brain regions work together. Results show that children who fail a hard version of an EF task and who are thought to have an immature frontal cortex, show robust frontal activity in an easy version of the task. We show how this effect can arise via posterior brain regions that provide on-the-job training for the frontal cortex, effectively teaching the frontal cortex adaptive patterns of brain activity on easy EF tasks. In this case, frontal cortex activation can be seen as both the cause and the consequence of rule switching. Results also show that older children have differential posterior cortical activation on easy and hard tasks that reflects continued refinement of brain networks even in skilled children. These data set the stage for new training programs to foster the development of EF skills in at-risk children.","2018-07","2018-12-21 16:22:53","2018-12-21 16:22:53","","","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: Older adults (n = 444; M-age = 74.5)-121 African Americans, 212 Whites, and 111 Hispanics-underwent an average of 5.3 annual study visits. Approximately half were cognitively normal at baseline (global Clinical Dementia Rating M = 0.5). Of the patients with dementia, most (79%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). MRI measures of gray matter volume (baseline and change), and hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes (baseline), were used to predict change in global cognition. Multilevel latent variable modeling was used to test the hypothesis that brain effects on cognitive change differed across ethnoracial groups. Results: In a multivariable model, global gray matter change was the strongest predictor of cognitive decline in Whites and African Americans and specific temporal lobe change added incremental explanatory power in Whites. Baseline WMH volume was the strongest predictor of cognitive decline in Hispanics and made an incremental contribution in Whites. Conclusions: We found ethnoracial group differences in associations of brain variables with cognitive decline. The unique patterns in Whites appeared to suggest a greater influence of AD in this group. In contrast, cognitive decline in African Americans and Hispanics was most uniquely attributable to global gray matter change and baseline WMH, respectively. Brain changes underlying cognitive decline in older adults are heterogeneous and depend on fixed and modifiable risk factors that differ based on ethnicity and race. General Scientific Summary Dementia in older adults is driven by systematic brain changes. However, the associations between changes in brain structure and cognitive decline are not uniform across ethnic and racial groups. Uniquely salient associations between brain structure and cognitive decline were found for global gray matter volume changes in African Americans, baseline white matter hyperintensities for Hispanics, and baseline white matter hyperintensities, global gray matter volume changes, and regional temporal lobe volume changes in Whites.","2018-07","2018-12-21 16:22:53","2018-12-21 16:22:53","","529-540","","5","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; cognition; cross-cultural comparison; dementia; neuroimaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test the hypothesis that imagery ability and types of stimuli interact to affect the format of representation and the choice of strategy in performing MR task, participants, grouped as good or poor imagers, were assessed using four MR tasks, comprising two sets of `Standard' cube figures and two sets of `non-Standard' ones, designed by withdrawing cubes from the Standard ones. Both good and poor imagers performed similarly under the two Standard conditions. Under non-Standard conditions, good imagers performed much faster in non-Standard objects than Standard ones, whereas poor imagers performed much slower in non-Standard objects than Standard ones.

We tested the hypothesis that the subtle denial of human attributes of local stakeholders (dehumanisation) produces negative expectations regarding the engagement of communities in the decision process, which may ultimately legitimise their exclusion. Three studies were conducted testing this hypothesis, all involving professionals with experience in implementing local projects. In the first two correlational studies we showed that a deficit view regarding local communities, a dehumanised idea of those residents and an unfavourable attitude towards their participation were associated. Furthermore, an experimental study was conducted, manipulating the images of the residents in a 2 warmth (high vs low) x 2 competence (high vs low) between-subjects design. Results showed that participants that read a description of the local community as being incompetent developed expectations of more violent and less conventional forms of protest. Moreover, the expectation of conventional protest procedures was associated with stronger support for their engagement in the process. These studies show the importance of psychosocial mediators from the technicians' perspective: an imagined competent public is easier to include in the decision process.","2018-07","2018-12-21 16:22:54","2018-12-21 16:22:54","","557-585","","3","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that other change factors mediate the alliance-outcome link on a within-person level over the treatment course. Method: Our sample consisted of 193 patients with major depression undergoing intensive inpatient cognitive-behavioral-based therapy. Each week, we assessed depressive symptoms (using the Beck Depression Inventory-II) and change factors during individual therapy. Multilevel mediation models were used to test our hypothesis. Results: As expected, within-person change in Alliance (differentiated into Emotional Bond and Contentment with the Therapist) as well as Mastery/Self-Efficacy and Problem Clarification predicted symptom change over the course of therapy. Moreover, the relation between Contentment with the Therapist and subsequent change in depression was mediated by increased Mastery/Self-Efficacy on a within-person level. Conclusions: Our data suggest that within-person change of alliance and other general change factors precede symptom change in depressive patients, and that the link between alliance and outcome may be partially mediated by enhanced Mastery/Self-Efficacy.

There is an absence of evidence concerning the impact on consumption of labeling alcohol products as lower in strength. The current study tests the hypothesis that labeling wine and beer as lower in alcohol increases their consumption. Method: Weekly wine and beer drinkers (n = 264) sampled from a representative panel of the general population of England were randomized to one of three groups to taste test drinks in a bar-laboratory varying only in the label displayed; Group 1: verbal descriptor Super Low combined with 4% alcohol by volume (ABV) for wine/1% ABV for beer; Group 2: verbal descriptor Low combined with 8% ABV for wine/3% ABV for beer; Group 3: no verbal descriptors of strength (Regular). Primary outcome was total volume (ml) of drink consumed. Results: The results supported the study hypothesis: the total amount of drink consumed increased as the label on the drink denoted successively lower alcohol strength, B-Lin= .71, p = .015, 95% CI [0.13. 1.30].

There was no significant difference in amount consumed between those offered drinks labeled as Low compared with Regular.

Partner support has been associated with positive coparenting, although findings have been mixed. Support from young parents' own parents (”grandparents”) has been linked to adaptive family outcomes and may be particularly protective for African American and Latino parents whose cultures espouse interdependence. This study examined partner support and grandparent support as individual predictors of change in coparenting quality, and tested whether grandparent support moderated the relationship between partner support and change in coparenting quality over the first postpartum year. Participants were 136 African American and Latina adolescent mothers (age range = 15-21 years) and their babies' fathers (15-41 years). Partner and grandparent support were measured at 6 months postpartum. Coparenting quality was measured at 6 and 12 months postpartum, and change in coparenting quality was measured using latent change scores. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis that the relationship between partner support and change in coparenting quality would be moderated by grandparent support. Fit indices indicated a well-fitted model. Results demonstrated that the moderator term (partner support x grandparent support) significantly predicted change in coparenting quality. Specifically, partner support was positively associated with changes in coparenting quality when grandparent support was high; however, that association became weaker and changed direction for lower levels of grandparent support. Findings highlight the need to assess parents' social support networks and grandparents' impact on the coparenting quality of this at-risk population.","2018-07","2018-12-21 16:22:56","2018-12-21 16:22:56","","2295-2304","","7","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescent parents; Coparenting; Ethnic minority families; Grandparents; Social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether this relationship exists in cyberspace and the variables that might reduce cyber aggression are largely unexplored. This presents an obstacle to fully understanding the origins of cyber aggression and to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. We conducted two studies to test the hypothesis that dispositional and experimentally primed attachment security would reduce cyber aggression after cyber ostracism. In Study 1, undergraduates were exposed to a cyber ostracism or inclusion condition in an online game, “Cyberball,” and then were given a chance to score the creative painting works of two other players in Cyberball. After cyber ostracism, participants with relatively high attachment avoidance (i.e., lower attachment security) showed higher aggressiveness than did participants with low avoidance (i.e., higher attachment security). In Study 2, all procedures were as the same as in Study 1 except for that, after playing the Cyberball game, participants received a priming manipulation for attachment security. After cyber ostracism, compared to those who were neutrally primed, participants who recalled an attachment figure exhibited less cyber aggression. These results might help to design strategies for effective prevention of aggressive behaviors in cyberspace. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on the Abriendo Puertas cohort of female sex workers living with HIV in the Dominican Republic, we used structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis that both HIV stigma and sex work stigma mediate the association between social cohesion and CCU and that they have a layered effect. The results indicated that HIV stigma mediated the association between social cohesion and CCU with clients and partners, while sex work-related stigma did not. There was no evidence of a layered HIV stigma and sex work stigma effect, which may be due to methodological limitations to handle highly correlated latent variables. Findings highlight the need to address internalized HIV stigma within the context of community-based approaches to enhance their HIV prevention impact. This will help to reduce the risk of HIV re-infection with a new distinct HIV viral strain, STI infection, and onward HIV transmission among female sex workers living with HIV.","2018-07","2018-12-21 16:22:58","2018-12-21 16:22:58","","1529-1539","","5","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Dominican Republic; Female sex workers; HIV prevention; People living with HIV; Social cohesion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This should be the case for controversial (vs. consensual) issues, where ambivalence can signal some competence. The participants in four experiments indeed evaluated ambivalence higher on a measure of social utility, compared to clear-cut (pro-normative and counter-normative) attitudes, when the attitude objects were controversial; they judged pro-normative attitudes higher for both social utility and social desirability when the attitude objects were consensual.

Such behavior is a result of future gains being discounted such that their value is rendered less than that of the immediate gain. Extreme discounting behaviors are associated with impulsivity and addiction. Given recent evidence of sleep's role in decision making, we tested the hypothesis that sleep would reduce delayed discounting behavior. Twenty young adults (M = 20.19 years, SD = 0.98 years; 6 males) performed a hypothetical delay discounting task, making a series of choices between an immediate reward (from $0 to $50) or a larger reward ($50) available at a delay of 2, 4, 8, 14, or 22 weeks. Participants performed the task before and after a mid-day nap, and before and after an equivalent interval of wake (within subject, order counterbalanced, wake, and sleep conditions separated by 1 week). As expected, indifference points decreased with longer delays both prior to and following the nap/wake interval. However, the impact of a nap interval on discounting did not differ from the impact of a wake interval. Thus, while sleep has been shown to play an active role in some financial decision-making tasks, a nap is not sufficient to change delay discounting behavior.","2018-06-22","2018-12-21 16:22:59","2018-12-21 16:22:59","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","decision making; discounting; economics; impulsivity; naps; sleep","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies from Bonnefon et al. (2009, 2011) investigate the effect of politeness on the interpretation of scalar utterances. They argue that when the scalar utterance is face-threatening (”Some people hated your speech”) (i) the scalar inference is less likely to be derived, and (ii) the semantic interpretation of “some” (at least some) is arrived at slowly and effortfully. This paper re-evaluates the role of politeness in the computation of scalar inferences by drawing on the distinction between “comprehension” and “epistemic assessment” of communicated information. In two experiments, we test the hypothesis that, in these face-threatening contexts, scalar inferences are largely derived but are less likely to be accepted as true. In line with our predictions, we find that slowdowns in the face-threatening condition are attributable to longer reaction times at the (latter) epistemic assessment stage, but not at the comprehension stage.","2018-06-13","2018-12-21 16:22:59","2018-12-21 16:22:59","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","epistemic vigilance; experimental pragmatics; face; politeness; scalar inference; some","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Metacognitive theory, in contrast, posits that OC symptoms develop as a result of maladaptive beliefs about thoughts themselves (i.e., thoughts are meaningful and powerful). Although both have empirical support, no study has yet investigated the relative contributions of these models in the prediction of OC symptom dimensions using a common sample. The present study tested the hypothesis that both obsessive and metacognitive beliefs uniquely predict OC symptom dimensions even after controlling for general distress. A nonclinical sample (N = 110) completed self-report questionnaires measuring general distress, obsessive beliefs, metacognitive beliefs, and OC symptoms. Linear regression analyses separately predicting OC symptom dimensions showed that (a) neither obsessive nor metacognitive beliefs uniquely predicted contamination symptoms, (b) both obsessive and metacognitive beliefs uniquely predicted responsibility for harm, (c) only metacognitive beliefs uniquely predicted unacceptable obsessional thoughts, and (d) only metacognitive beliefs uniquely predicted symmetry concerns.

The authors sought to investigate whether early-life victimization stress is associated with genome-wide DNA methylation. Method: The authors tested the hypothesis that victimization is associated with DNA methylation in the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative 1994-1995 birth cohort of 2,232 twins born in England and Wales and assessed at ages 5, 7, 10, 12, and 18 years. Multiple forms of victimization were ascertained in childhood and adolescence (including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; neglect; exposure to intimate-partner violence; bullying; cyber-victimization; and crime). Results: Epigenome-wide analyses of polyvictimization across childhood and adolescence revealed few significant associations with DNA methylation in peripheral blood at age 18, but these analyses were confounded by tobacco smoking and/or did not survive co-twin control tests. Secondary analyses of specific forms of victimization revealed sparse associations with DNA methylation that did not replicate across different operationalizations of the same putative victimization experience. Hypothesis-driven analyses of six candidate genes in the stress response (NR3C1, FKBP5, BDNF, AVP, CRHR1, SLC6A4) did not reveal predicted associations with DNA methylation in probes annotated to these genes. Conclusions: Findings from this epidemiological analysis of the epigenetic effects of early-life stress do not support the hypothesis of robust changes in DNA methylation in victimized young people. We need to come to terms with the possibility that epigenetic epidemiology is not yet well matched to experimental, nonhuman models in uncovering the biological embedding of stress.","2018-06","2018-12-21 16:23:00","2018-12-21 16:23:00","","517-529","","6","175","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The accelerated aging hypothesis of SZ has been advanced to explain these observations, it posits that SZ-associated factors accelerate the progressive biological changes associated with normal aging. Testing the hypothesis has been limited by the absence of robust, meaningful, and multi-tissue measures of biological age. Recently, a method was described in which DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at 353 genomic sites are used to produce “DNAm age”, an estimate of biological age with advantages over existing measures. We used this method and 3 publicly-available DNAm datasets, 1 from brain and 2 from blood, to test the hypothesis. The brain dataset was composed of data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 232 non-psychiatric control (NPC) and 195 SZ subjects. Blood dataset #1 was composed of data from whole blood of 304 NPC and 332 SZ subjects, and blood dataset #2 was composed of data from whole blood of 405 NPC and 260 SZ subjects. DNAm age and chronological age correlated strongly (r = 0.92-0.95, p < 0.0001) in both NPC and SZ subjects in all 3 datasets. DNAm age acceleration did not differ between NPC and SZ subjects in the brain dataset (t - 0.52, p - 0.60), blood dataset #1 (t = 1.51, p = 0.13), or blood dataset #2 (t = 0.93, p = 0.35). Consistent with our previous findings from a smaller study of postmortem brains, our findings suggest there is no acceleration of brain or blood aging in SZ and, thus, do not support the accelerated aging hypothesis of SZ.

Our experimental studies test the role of these variables in determining responses to the elevated salience of past ingroup harm doing. Collective nostalgia was associated with lower collective guilt especially after reminders of America's harm doing in Study 1.

We tested the hypothesis that stereo input modulates the brain activity related to perceptual analyses of 3D shape configuration during image classification. High-density (256-channel) electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to record the temporal dynamics of visual shape processing under conditions of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D visual presentation. On each trial, observers made image classification judgements (Same'/'Different') to two briefly presented, multi-part, novel objects. On different-object trials, stimuli could either share volumetric parts but not the global 3D shape configuration and have different parts but the same global 3D shape configuration or differ on both aspects. Analyses using mass univariate contrasts showed that the earliest sensitivity to 2D versus 3D viewing appeared as a negative deflection over posterior locations on the N1 component between 160 and 220 ms post-stimulus onset. Subsequently, event-related potential (ERP) modulations during the N2 time window between 240 and 370 ms were linked to image classification. N2 activity reflected two distinct components - an early N2 (240-290 ms) and a late N2 (290-370 ms) - that showed different patterns of responses to 2D and 3D input and differential sensitivity to 3D object structure. The results revealed that stereo input modulates the neural correlates of 3D object shape. We suggest that this reflects differential perceptual processing of object shape under conditions of stereo or mono input. These findings challenge current theories that attribute no functional role for stereo input during 3D shape perception.","2018-06","2018-12-21 16:23:01","2018-12-21 16:23:01","","1419-1430","","6","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","3D shape perception; ERP; evoked potentials; global configuration; local part structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In all studies, participants, who believed that they were interacting with another person in a 30-round repeated prisoner's dilemma game, made strong dispositional inferences about counterparts. However, the specific dispositions they inferred depended upon the type of variability the counterpart displayed: positive dispositions (e.g., rational) when the counterpart's behavior followed a systematic (if. then.) pattern that made sense given the context; negative dispositions (e.g., irrational) when the counterpart's behavior was unsystematic, or when the if. then. pattern was inappropriate for the context.

In a large diary study with N = 744 young (18-39 years), middle-aged (40-59 years), and older adults (60-83 years), we tested the hypothesis that the adaptiveness of social goals changes across adulthood: Social approach goals were hypothesized to be adaptive during young adulthood when adult social relationships are to be established. In contrast, social avoidance goals were hypothesized to become more adaptive with age as people are increasingly motivated to avoid interpersonal tension. Our findings support these hypotheses: Social approach goals were positively and social avoidance goals negatively associated with younger but not with middle-aged and older adults' daily social wellbeing.

Wouldn't that be a further concern for people prone to problem gambling and other forms of addiction, like those related to eating? Electroencephalography was employed to investigate this possibility using probabilistic feedback manipulations and measures of known event-related potentials (ERPs) related to reward processing. We tested the hypothesis-that reward-based ERPs would occur even in the absence of a tangible reward and when manipulations on expectation are implicit. The well-known P300 response potential was a key focus, and was assessed in non-gambling volunteer undergraduates on a task involving experimentally-manipulated probabilities of positive or negative feedback comprising three trial types-80, 50, or 20% positive feedback. A feedback stimulus (F1) followed a guess response between two possible outcomes (implicit win/loss), and then a second feedback stimulus (F2) was presented to confirm an alleged `win' or `loss' (explicit win/loss). Results revealed that amplitude of the P300 in F1-locked data (implicit manipulation) was larger (more positive) on average for feedback outcomes that were manipulated to be less likely than expected. The effect is pronounced after increased time on task (later trials), even though the majority of participants were not explicitly aware of our probability manipulations. For the explicit effects in F2-locked data, no meaningful or significant effects were observed. These findings point to the existence of proposed success-response mechanisms that operate not only explicitly but also with implicit manipulations that do not involve any direct indication of a win or loss, and are not associated with tangible rewards. Thus, there seems to be a non-explicit form of perception (we call `implicit') associated with an internal experience of wins/losses (in the absence of actual rewards or losses) that can be measured in associated brain processes. The potential significance of these findings is discussed in terms of implications for problem gambling.","2018-06","2018-12-21 16:23:04","2018-12-21 16:23:04","","449-463","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","EEG; FRN; Gambling; P300; Reward task","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because working memory resources are limited, it is adaptive to focus processing on the most relevant information. We used a retro-cue paradigm to determine the extent to which monkey working memory possesses control mechanisms that focus processing on the most relevant representations. Monkeys saw a sample array of images, and shortly after the array disappeared, they were visually cued to a location that had been occupied by one of the sample images. The cue indicated which image should be remembered for the upcoming recognition test. By determining whether the monkeys were more accurate and quicker to respond to cued images compared to un-cued images, we tested the hypothesis that monkey working memory focuses processing on relevant information. We found a memory benefit for the cued image in terms of accuracy and retrieval speed with a memory load of two images. With a memory load of three images, we found a benefit in retrieval speed but only after shortening the onset latency of the retro-cue. Our results demonstrate previously unknown flexibility in the cognitive control of memory in monkeys, suggesting that control mechanisms in working memory likely evolved in a common ancestor of humans and monkeys more than 32 million years ago. Future work should be aimed at understanding the interaction between memory load and the ability to control memory resources, and the role of working memory control in generating differences in cognitive capacity among primates.","2018-06","2018-12-21 16:23:05","2018-12-21 16:23:05","","26-35","","","175","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention; Cognitive control; Primate; Retro-cue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This experiment allows us to distinguish between accurate and less accurate listeners. Additionally, it allows to distinguish between participants that are easily visually distracted and those who are not. To do so, two previously conducted laboratory experiments werere-analyzed. The first experiment focuses on self-reported noise annoyance in a living room context, whereas the second experiment focuses on the perceived pleasantness of using outdoor public spaces. In the first experiment, the influence of visibility of vegetation on self-reported noise annoyance was modified by audiovisual aptitude. In the second one, it was found that the overall appraisal of walking across a bridge is influenced by audiovisual aptitude, in particular when a visually intrusive noise barrier is used to reduce highway traffic noise levels.

However, previous research on the effect of dissociation in treatment outcomes pertained to specific patients and trauma populations. Objective: To test the hypothesis that the presence of the dissociative subtype of PTSD (DS) would have a detrimental effect on the outcome of an intensive trauma-focused treatment programme. Methods: PTSD symptom scores (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS] and PTSD Symptom Scale Self-Report [PSS-SR]) were analysed using the data of 168 consecutive patients (70.6% female) who had been exposed to a wide variety of multiple traumas, including childhood sexual abuse, and of whom 98.2% were diagnosed with severe PTSD (CAPS > 65). Most of them suffered from multiple comorbidities and 38 (22.6%) met the criteria for DS. They took part in an intensive trauma-focused treatment programme for PTSD. Pre- and post-treatment differences were compared between patients with and without DS. Results: Large effect sizes were achieved for PTSD symptom reduction on CAPS and the PSS-SR, both for patients with DS and those without. Although patients with DS showed a significantly greater PTSD symptom severity at the beginning, and throughout, treatment, both groups showed equal reductions in PTSD symptoms. Of those who met the criteria for DS, 26 (68.4%) no longer fulfilled the criteria for this classification after treatment. Conclusion: The results provide no support for the notion that the presence of DS negatively impacts trauma-focused treatment outcomes. Accordingly, PTSD patients with DS should not be denied effective trauma-focused treatments.","2018-05-18","2018-12-21 16:23:05","2018-12-21 16:23:05","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","dissociation; dissociative subtype of PTSD; EMDR therapy; intensive trauma-focused treatment; Posttraumatic stress disorder; prolonged exposure; stabilization phase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While acoustically motivated sound changes are well-documented, research on the articulatory and audiovisual-perceptual aspects of sound change is limited. This paper investigates the interaction of articulatory variation and audiovisual speech perception in the Northern Cities Vowel Shift (NCVS), a pattern of sound change observed in the Great Lakes region of the United States. We focus specifically on the maintenance of the contrast between the vowels /alpha/ and /(sic)/, both of which are fronted as a result of the NCVS. We present results from two experiments designed to test how the NCVS is produced and perceived. In the first experiment, we present data from an articulatory and acoustic analysis of the production of fronted /alpha/ and /(sic)/. We find that some speakers distinguish /(sic)/ from /alpha/ with a combination of both tongue position and lip rounding, while others do so using either tongue position or lip rounding alone. For speakers who distinguish /(sic)/ from /alpha/ along only one articulatory dimension /alpha/ and /(sic)/ are acoustically more similar than for speakers who produce multiple articulatory distinctions. While all three groups of speakers maintain some degree of acoustic contrast between the vowels, the question is raised as to whether these articulatory strategies differ in their perceptibility. In the perception experiment, we test the hypothesis that visual speech cues play a role in maintaining contrast between the two sounds. The results of this experiment suggest that articulatory configurations in which /(sic)/ is produced with unround lips are perceptually weaker than those in which /(sic)/ is produced with rounding, even though these configurations result in acoustically similar output. We argue that these findings have implications for theories of sound change and variation in at least two respects: (1) visual cues can shape phonological systems through misperception-based sound change, and (2) phonological systems may be optimized not only for auditory but also for visual perceptibility.","2018-05-15","2018-12-21 16:23:06","2018-12-21 16:23:06","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","articulatory variation; audiovisual speech perception; misperception; Northern Cities Vowel Shift; sound change; ultrasound tongue imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the purpose of experimental verification of the idea that there is a dynamics of recognition of unnoticed meanings of ambiguous images, two experiments were conducted. The ambiguous images and reversible pictures were used as stimuli for memorization which had to be recognized immediately after presentation, the next day, a week and a month later. We tested the hypothesis according to which previously unnoticed meanings of ambiguous images tend to penetrate into consciousness as recognition errors in the course of time. The experimental results are consistent with the hypothesis: a month after the presentation the number of recognition errors for inverted characters of the reversible pictures reached 71.2%; the number of false recognition errors for descriptions of noticed meanings of ambiguous images with elements of alternative meanings reached 67,8% (both values are significantly different from those in control conditions). The comparison of several theoretical approaches to polysemy perception allows us to conclude that the best explanation for the obtained results can be proposed by the negative choice theory. This theory postulates that unnoticed polysemy interpretations show themselves in two ways: they are missed repeatedly in the same context but penetrate into consciousness as errors when context changes.","2018-06","2018-12-21 16:23:07","2018-12-21 16:23:07","","44-56","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","Russian","","","","","","","","","","","ambiguous figures; inhibition; negative choice; recognition errors; reversible figures; unnoticed meanings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Men who respond aggressively to a woman's sexual rejection are likely to score high on risk factors associated with sexual aggression and to convince themselves that she is at fault. This study investigated how sexual dominance motivation and casual sex attitudes interact with “in-the-moment” hostile perceptions of the woman to predict the likelihood of an aggressive response. Method: Male participants (N = 77) completed an online survey including self-report measures of sexual dominance motivation and casual sex attitudes. In a separate session, participants completed a laboratory study in which they interacted with a female agent in a dating simulation, allowing them to make nonsexual choices, sexual choices that were accepted, and sexual choices that were rejected. Immediate responses to sexual rejection were categorized as aggressive (n = 25) or nonaggressive (n = 52). After the simulation ended, participants answered questions about their perceptions of the situation and the woman. Moderated multiple logistic regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Results: The hypothesized interactions were found such that men with high scores on sexual dominance motivation and positive attitudes about casual sex had a greater probability of responding aggressively when they formed extremely hostile perceptions of the woman who rejected them. Conclusions: These findings provide insight into the processes by which men respond aggressively to women's refusals and highlight the need for training that encourages benevolent attributions and nonviolent strategies to deal with sexual rejection.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:07","2018-12-21 16:23:07","","349-357","","3, SI","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aggression; perpetration; rejection; sexual aggression; sexual refusals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrary to our expectation, undergraduates and academics displayed a recency bias, anchoring their judgment on the research outcome presented last.

However, knowledge of the relationship between specific socioecological factors and antisocial behavior remains scant. This research focused on humans' residential mobility and explored its influence on antisocial behavior. Three studies were designed to test the hypothesis that individuals with high (vs. low) residential mobility tend to engage in antisocial behavior more frequently. The results showed that both self-reported residential mobility (Study 1) and manipulated residential mobility (Studies 2 and 3) positively predicted individuals' antisocial level. Furthermore, we found that social monitoring played a role in moderating the linkage between residential mobility and antisocial behavior (Study 3); individuals with high residential mobility decreased their antisocial behavior when they were observed by artificial eyes, while individuals with low residential mobility did the opposite. Taken together, this research suggests that, generally speaking, residential mobility is one socioecological factor that increases antisocial behavior, and that social monitoring can have diverse effects on such behavior.

Results and Conclusions: Each additional social role reported at baseline was associated with less of a decline in lung function between baseline and the ifollow-up assessment four years later. The association withstood controls for demographics, weight, and height and was mediated by more positive and less negative affect and lower rates of cigarette smoking and more physical activity. Roles were mostly substitutable, with both high (spouse, parent, friends, relatives) and low (employee, religious service attendee, volunteer, members of other groups) intimacy roles independently contributing to less age related decline in lung function.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:08","2018-12-21 16:23:08","","472-480","","5","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; lung function; social integration; social roles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lower education and income are both associated with lower screening rates. Both cognitive (e.g., perceived barriers) and affective (e.g., disgust, fear) decision-making constructs are known determinants of colorectal cancer screening behavior. This study tests the hypotheses that SES may be related to decision-making constructs and that this SFS-decision-making construct relation may contribute to explaining the SES-screening behavior disparity. Method: Surveys assessing perceived benefits and barriers to screening, self-efficacy, positive and negative affective associations with colonoscopy, fear of colonoscopy, colorectal cancer knowledge, past screening behavior, and demographics including education and income were completed by 2,015 African American participants ages 50 and older. Both uiuvariable and multivariable relations of SES to decision making constructs were examined, as were univariable and multivariable models of the indirect effect of SES on screening via decision-making constructs. Results: Socioeconomic status was related to both screening compliance and the decision-making constructs. Bootstrap modeling of the indirect effect showed that the total effect of the SES-screening behavior relation included an indirect effect via social cognitive decision-making constructs. Conclusion: These findings suggest that cognitive and affective decision-making constructs account for at least some of the SES disparities in colorectal cancer screening behavior. As such, more research is needed to explore the intra individual-level influences of disparities in colorectal cancer screening. In addition, work is needed to develop effective intervention approaches to address the relation of SES to decision-making constructs.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:09","2018-12-21 16:23:09","","481-490","","5","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","African American; colonoscopy/utilization; early detection of cancer/utilization; guideline adherence; Socioeconomic factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Informed by the strength model of self-regulation, four studies (N = 546) tested the hypothesis that willingness to plan is linked to good self-control. A correlational study (N = 201) found that people high in trait self-control had done more planning than other people and also intended to make more plans during the upcoming week. A laboratory experiment (N = 105) induced a state of ego depletion (i.e., impaired self-control) by having some participants continuously break pre-established motoric habits, and afterward these participants were less willing to make plans for the next four weeks than control participants. A field experiment (N = 112) used a naturally occurring induction of decision fatigue (IKEA shopping) and again found that ego depletion reduced planning. Specifically, fatigued shoppers exiting the store expressed more reluctance to make long-term plans than shoppers who were just arriving at the store. A final laboratory experiment (N = 128) found that ego-depleted participants were only half as likely to choose a planning task as control participants, and identified effort avoidance as a mediator mechanism. Crucially, the three experimental manipulations were longer and stronger than the 5-min depletion tasks often used in previous research (24 min; 2 h; 30 min), and manipulation checks confirmed severe and significant ego depletion. Depletion had no effects on aspirational goals or the desire to relax. We conclude that wants and desires come easily, while planning requires mental work akin to self-control. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:09","2018-12-21 16:23:09","","127-141","","","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision fatigue; Ego depletion; Planning; Prospection; Self-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The principle of inverse effectiveness (PoIE) states how the multisensory gain is maximal when responses to the unisensory constituents of the stimuli are weak. It is one of the basic principles underlying multisensory processing of spatiotemporally corresponding crossmodal stimuli that are well established at behavioral as well as neural levels. It is not yet clear, however, how modality-specific stimulus features influence discrimination of subtle changes in a crossmodally corresponding feature belonging to another modality. Here, we tested the hypothesis that reliance on visual cues to pitch discrimination follow the PoIE at the interindividual level (i.e., varies with varying levels of auditory-only pitch discrimination abilities). Using an oddball pitch discrimination task, we measured the effect of varying visually perceived vertical position in participants exhibiting a wide range of pitch discrimination abilities (i.e., musicians and nonmusicians). Visual cues significantly enhanced pitch discrimination as measured by the sensitivity index d', and more so in the crossmodally congruent than incongruent condition. The magnitude of gain caused by compatible visual cues was associated with individual pitch discrimination thresholds, as predicted by the PoIE. This was not the case for the magnitude of the congruence effect, which was unrelated to individual pitch discrimination thresholds, indicating that the pitch-height association is robust to variations in auditory skills. Our findings shed light on individual differences in multisensory processing by suggesting that relevant multisensory information that crucially aids some perceivers' performance may be of less importance to others, depending on their unisensory abilities.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:10","2018-12-21 16:23:10","","999-1010","","4","80","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hearing; Multisensory processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polygenic risk manifested during primary schooling in lower cognitive abilities, lower self-control, academic difficulties, and truancy, and it was associated with a life-course-persistent pattern of antisocial behavior that onsets in childhood and persists into adulthood.

To reconcile these findings, we tested the hypothesis that directing attention away makes a memory representation vulnerable to interference from the test pattern, but only temporarily so. When given sufficient time, the robustness of VWM can be restored so that it is protected against test interference. In 5 experiments, participants remembered a single grating for a later memory test. In the crucial conditions, participants also performed a letter change detection task in between, during the delay period. Experiments 1-3 demonstrate and replicate the predicted effect: The intervening task had an adverse effect on memory performance, but only when the test display appeared immediately after the secondary task. At longer delays of 3.5 s, memory performance was on a par with conditions in which there was no intervening task. By varying the similarity of the test pattern to the memorized pattern, Experiments 4 and 5 further showed that performance suffered at early test intervals, unless the test item was dissimilar to the memory item. The results provide positive evidence for test interference, and demonstrates that the susceptibility to interference only occurs temporarily, as memory is restored when attention is allowed to return to the memorandum.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:11","2018-12-21 16:23:11","","722-733","","5","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","focus of attention; fragile memory; test interference; visual working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One explanation for this finding is the early onset hypothesis, which is based on the assumptions that increased alertness shortens stimulus-encoding time and that cognitive control involves gradually focusing attention during a trial. The author tested the hypothesis in 3 experiments by manipulating alertness and stimulus quality (which were intended to shorten and lengthen stimulus-encoding time, respectively) in an arrow-based flanker task involving congruent and incongruent stimuli. Replicating past findings, the alerting manipulation led to shorter RTs but larger congruency effects on alert trials than on no-alert trials. The stimulus-quality manipulation led to longer RTs and larger congruency effects for degraded stimuli than for intact stimuli. These results provide mixed support for the early onset hypothesis, but the author discusses how data and theory might be reconciled if stimulus quality affects stimulus-encoding time and the rate of evidence accumulation in the decision process.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:12","2018-12-21 16:23:12","","756-766","","5","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alertness; cognitive control; flanker task; selective attention; stimulus degradation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that greater spirituality than religiosity, separate from the overall level of spirituality and religiosity, predicts longitudinal increases in depression. A national sample of midlife adults completed diagnostic interviews and questionnaires of spiritual and religious intensity up to three times over 18 years. In time-lagged multilevel models, overall spirituality plus religiosity did not predict depression. However, in support of the hypothesis, greater spirituality than religiosity significantly predicted subsequent increases in depressive symptoms and risk for major depressive disorder (odds ratio = 1.34).

N1 amplitudes in individuals with schizophrenia saturate at a lower asymptote, thus giving rise to a reduced dynamic range. Reduced N1 dynamic range is a putative electrophysiological biomarker of altered sensory memory function in individuals with the disease. To date, it is not clear what determines N1 dynamic range and what causes reduced N1 dynamic range in individuals with schizophrenia. Here we test the hypothesis that reduced N1 dynamic range results from a shift in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance toward an excitation-deficient or inhibition-dominant state. Methods: We recorded auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) while 4 macaque monkeys passively listened to sequences of sounds of random pitch and stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA). Three independent experiments tested the effect of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor channel blockers ketamine and MK-801 as well as the-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor-positive allosteric modulator midazolam on the dynamic range of a putative monkey N1 homologue and 4 other AEP components. Results: Ketamine, MK-801 and midazolam reduced peak N1 amplitudes for the longest SOAs. Other AEP components were also affected, but revealed distinct patterns of susceptibility for the glutamatergic and GABA-ergic drugs. Different patterns of susceptibility point toward differences in the circuitry maintaining E/I balance of individual components. Limitations: The study used systemic pharmacological interventions that may have acted on targets outside of the auditory cortex. Conclusion: The N1 dynamic range may be a marker of altered E/I balance. Reduced N1 dynamic range in individuals with schizophrenia may indicate that the auditory cortex is in an excitation-deficient or inhibition-dominant state. This may be the result of an incomplete compensation for a primary deficit in excitatory drive.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:13","2018-12-21 16:23:13","","182-193","","3","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, prospective intolerance of uncertainty (P-IU) has been defined as a factor leading to excessive responding in uncertain situations. Thus, uncertain avoidance situations may be taken as a relevant scenario to examine the role of intolerance of uncertainty as a factor that facilitates excessive and inflexible avoidance behavior. In our experiment, we tested the hypothesis that P-IU is associated with excessive and inflexible avoidance in an outcome devaluation paradigm. Specifically, healthy participants learned in a free-operant discriminative task to avoid an aversive sound, and were tested in extinction to measure the sensitivity of avoidance responses to the devaluation of the sound aversiveness. The results showed that an increase in P-IU was positively associated to an increase in insensitivity to the devaluation. Moreover, P-IU was also related to an increase in the frequency of avoidance responses during the instrumental learning phase, and to resistance to extinction. Interestingly, these associations involving P-IU were still significant when trait anxiety was controlled for. The pattern of results suggests that P-IU may be a vulnerability factor for excessive and inflexible avoidance, which, in turn, has been found to be associated with several mental disorders.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:13","2018-12-21 16:23:13","","34-43","","","104","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Avoidance; Generalization of avoidance behavior; Intolerance of uncertainty; Outcome devaluation; Resistance to extinction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the facial-feedback hypothesis, the facial activity associated with particular emotional expressions can influence people's affective experiences. Recently, a replication attempt of this effect in 17 laboratories around the world failed to find any support for the effect. We hypothesize that the reason for the failure of replication is that the replication protocol deviated from that of the original experiment in a critical factor. In all of the replication studies, participants were alerted that they would be monitored by a video camera, whereas the participants in the original study were not monitored, observed, or recorded. Previous findings indicate that feeling monitored or observed reduces reliance on internal cues in making judgments. Therefore, we hypothesize that recording the participants in the replication experiments reduced their reliance on the facial-feedback. To test the hypothesis, we replicated the facial-feedback experiment in 2 conditions: one with a video-camera and one without it. The results revealed a significant facial-feedback effect in the absence of a camera, which was eliminated in the camera's presence. These findings suggest that minute differences in the experimental protocol might lead to theoretically meaningful changes in the outcomes. In our view, the theoretical and methodological approach advocated by our study changes failed replications from being the “end of the road” regarding entire fields of study into a new road for growth regarding our understanding of human nature.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:13","2018-12-21 16:23:13","","657-664","","5","114","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","camera presence; context effects; facial-feedback; feeling observed; replications in social psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because many societal phenomena are enormously complex, people's understanding of them often relies on heuristic shortcuts. For instance, when generating explanations for such phenomena (e.g., why does this group have low status?), people often rely on facts that they can retrieve easily from memory - facts that are skewed toward inherent or intrinsic features (e.g., this group is unintelligent). We hypothesized that this bias in the content of heuristic explanations leads to a tendency to (1) view socioeconomic stratification as acceptable and (2) prefer current societal arrangements to alternative ones, two hallmarks of conservative ideology. Moreover, since the inherence bias in explanation is present across development, we expected it to shape children's proto-political judgments as well. Three studies with adults and 4- to 8-year-old children (N = 784) provided support for these predictions: Not only did individual differences in reliance on inherent explanations uniquely predict endorsement of conservative views (particularly the stratification-supporting component; Study 1), but manipulations of this explanatory bias also had downstream consequences for political attitudes in both children and adults (Studies 2 and 3). This work contributes to our understanding of the origins of political attitudes.","2018-05","2018-12-21 16:23:14","2018-12-21 16:23:14","","","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied a longitudinal cohort of UHR individuals (n = 39) and compared two groups (converters, n = 14 vs. non-converters, n = 25). A longitudinal methylomic study was conducted using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip covering half a million cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites across the human genome from whole-blood samples. We used two statistical methods to investigate the variability of methylation probes. (i) The search for longitudinal variable methylation probes (VMPs) based on median comparisons identified two VMPs in converters only. The first CpG was located in the MACROD2 gene and the second CpG was in an intergenic region at 8q24.21. (ii) The detection of outliers using variance analysis related to private epimutations identified a dozen CpGs in converters only and highlighted two genes (RAC1 and SPHK1) from the sphingolipid signaling pathway. Our study is the first to support increased methylome variability during conversion to psychosis. We speculate that stochastic factors could increase DNA methylation variability and have a role in the complex pathophysiology of conversion to psychosis as well as in other psychiatric diseases.","2018-04-26","2018-12-21 16:23:15","2018-12-21 16:23:15","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An online/offline integration is proposed to unite self-identity, interpersonal relationships, and social functioning with both cognitive and behavioral aspects by following the principles of communication, transfer, consistency, and “offline-first” priorities. To begin to test the hypothesis regarding the relationship between integration level and psychological outcomes, data for the present study were collected from 626 undergraduate students (41.5% males). Participants completed scales for online and offline integration, Internet addiction, pros and cons of Internet use, loneliness, extraversion, and life satisfaction. The findings revealed that subjects with higher level of online/offline integration have higher life satisfaction, greater extraversion, and more positive perceptions of the Internet and less loneliness, lower Internet addiction, and fewer negative perceptions of the Internet. Integration mediates the link between extraversion and psychological outcomes, and it may be the mechanism underlying the difference between the “rich get richer” and social compensation hypotheses. The implications of the online and offline integration hypothesis are discussed.","2018-04-13","2018-12-21 16:23:15","2018-12-21 16:23:15","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","healthy Internet use; integration hypothesis; integration principles; Internet addiction; Online and Offline Integration Scale; problematic Internet use; rich get richer; social compensation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that poor nocturnal sleep, defined as short total sleep time or low slow-wave sleep, would moderate the relationship between cardiovascular reactivity and IMT. Methods: Participants (N = 99, 65.7% female, age = 59.3 +/- 9.3 years) completed a two-night laboratory sleep study and cardiovascular examination where sleep and IMT were measured.

Methods: A parallel-group trial was conducted. Women in their second trimester (N = 134) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of wait list, bimonthly pregnancy education classes, or twice weekly low-to-moderate intensity resistance training. Resistance training involved one abdominal exercise with no external load and five exercises (leg extension, leg press, arm lat pull, leg curl, and lumbar extension) with an external load that gradually progressed, and the total active exercise time during each exercise session was approximately 17 minutes. Quality of life and mood were measured before and after the interventions using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey and Profile of Mood States.

Research findings revealed that personality traits are the best predictors of intrinsic motivations for social media use. The Big Five traits of agreeableness and extraversion positively affected social interaction and self-presentation, whereas conscientiousness negatively affected self-presentation. Additionally, the results indicated that demographic variables of age and gender affect intrinsic motivations for social media use. Compared with females, males were more likely to utilize social media to express themselves and expand their social interactions. Moreover, participants older than 25 years demonstrated a lower level of self-presentational needs than did those aged 25 and younger. Our findings further confirm that differences among individuals, largely rooted in personality traits and demographic characteristics, contribute to various motivations for social media use.","2018-04","2018-12-21 16:23:17","2018-12-21 16:23:17","","667-682","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agreeableness; conscientiousness; extraversion; individual difference; intrinsic motivation; social media use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methamphetamine self-administration increases neurotensin levels in the ventral tegmental area, but the consequences for self-administration behavior have not been described. Here we test the hypothesis that antagonizing neurotensin receptors in the ventral tegmental area attenuates the acquisition of methamphetamine self-administration and methamphetamine intake. Methods: We implanted mice with an indwelling catheter in the right jugular vein and bilateral cannulae directed at the ventral tegmental area. Mice were then trained to nose-poke for i.v. infusions of methamphetamine (0.1 mg/kg/infusion) on a fixed ratio 3 schedule. Results: Mice receiving microinfusions of the neurotensin NTS1/NTS2 receptor antagonist SR142948A in the ventral tegmental area (10 ng/side) prior to the first 5 days of methamphetamine self-administration required more sessions to reach acquisition criteria. Methamphetamine intake was decreased in SR142948A-treated mice both during training and later during maintenance of self-administration. Drug seeking during extinction, cue-induced reinstatement, and progressive ratio schedules was also reduced in the SR142948A group. The effects of SR142948A were not related to changes in basal locomotor activity or methamphetamine psychomotor properties. In both SR142948A- and saline-treated mice, a strong positive correlation between methamphetamine intake and enhanced locomotor activity was observed. Conclusion: Our results suggest that neurotensin input in the ventral tegmental area during initial methamphetamine exposure contributes to the acquisition of methamphetamine self-administration and modulates later intake and methamphetamine-seeking behavior in mice. Furthermore, our results highlight the role of endogenous neurotensin in the ventral tegmental area in the reinforcing efficacy of methamphetamine, independent of its psychomotor effects.","2018-04","2018-12-21 16:23:18","2018-12-21 16:23:18","","361-370","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","methamphetamine; mouse; Neurotensin; self-administration; VTA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How do signals of understanding and misunderstanding affect the coordination of language use in conversation? Using a chat tool and a maze-based reference task, we test two experimental manipulations that selectively interfere with feedback in live conversation: (a) Attenuation that replaces positive signals of understanding such as right or okay with weaker, more provisional signals such as errr or umm and (2) Amplification that replaces relatively specific signals of misunderstanding from clarification requests such as on the left? with generic signals of trouble such as huh? or eh?. The results show that Amplification promotes rapid convergence on more systematic, abstract ways of describing maze locations while Attenuation has no significant effect. We interpret this as evidence that running repairsthe processes of dealing with misunderstandings on the flyare key drivers of semantic coordination in dialogue. This suggests a new direction for experimental work on conversation and a productive way to connect the empirical accounts of Conversation Analysis with the representational and processing concerns of Formal Semantics and Psycholinguistics.

In this article, we test the hypothesis that understanding sentential negation (e.g., You will not cut the bread) reuses the neural circuitry of response inhibition. Participants read manual action sentences with either affirmative or negative polarity, embedded in a Stop-Signal paradigm, while their EEG was recorded. The results showed that the inhibition-related N1 and P3 components were enhanced by successful inhibition. Most important, the early N1 amplitude was also modulated by sentence polarity, producing the largest values for successful inhibitions in the context of negative sentences, whereas no polarity effect was found for failing inhibition or go trials. The estimated neural sources for N1 effects revealed activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus, a typical inhibition-related area. Also, the estimated stop-signal reaction time was larger in trials with negative sentences. These results provide strong evidence that action-related negative sentences consume neural resources of response inhibition, resulting in less efficient processing in the Stop-Signal task.","2018-04","2018-12-21 16:23:19","2018-12-21 16:23:19","","10-18","","","112","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Brain sources; ERPs; Inhibition; Negation; Stop signal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, it has been subdivided into inhibition of prepotent responses (i.e., the ability to stop dominant responses) and resistance to distracter interference (i.e., the ability to ignore distracting information). The present study investigated the unity and diversity of inhibition as a psychometric construct, and tested the hypothesis of an inhibition deficit in older age. We measured inhibition in young and old adults with 11 established laboratory tasks: antisaccade, stop-signal, color Stroop, number Stroop, arrow flanker, letter flanker, Simon, global-local, positive and negative compatibility tasks, and n-2 repetition costs in task switching. In both age groups, the inhibition measures from individual tasks had good reliabilities, but correlated only weakly among each other. Structural equation modeling identified a 2-factor model with factors for inhibition of prepotent responses and resistance to distracter interference. Older adults scored worse in the inhibition of prepotent response, but better in the resistance to distracter interference. However, the model had low explanatory power. Together, these findings call into question inhibition as a psychometric construct and the hypothesis of an inhibition deficit in older age.","2018-04","2018-12-21 16:23:20","2018-12-21 16:23:20","","501-526","","4","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adult aging; Bayesian hypothesis testing; cognitive control; executive functions; structural equation modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated under what conditions such a bias occurs in unselected samples. According to contingent-capture theory, an irrelevant cue only captures attention if it matches an attentional control setting. Therefore, we first tested the hypothesis that an attentional control setting tuned to threat must be activated in (non-anxious) individuals. In Experiment 1, we used a dot-probe task with a manipulation of attentional control settings (threat' - set vs. control set). Surprisingly, we found an (anxiety-independent) attentional bias to angry faces that was not moderated by attentional control settings. Since we presented two stimuli (i.e., a target and a distractor) on the target screen in Experiment 1 (a necessity to realise the test of contingent capture), but most dot-probe studies only employ a single target, we conducted Experiment 2 to test the hypothesis that attentional bias in the general population is contingent on target competition. Participants performed a dot-probe task, involving presentation of a stand-alone target or a target competing with a distractor. We found an (anxiety-independent) attentional bias towards angry faces in the latter but not the former condition. This suggests that attentional bias towards angry faces in unselected samples is not contingent on attentional control settings but on target competition.","2018-04","2018-12-21 16:23:21","2018-12-21 16:23:21","","975-988","","4","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attentional bias; contingent capture; dot-probe task; spatial attention; target competition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AimsTo test the hypotheses that (1) each of two psychological interventions administered separately - cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or positive psychology intervention (PPI) - would be more effective than treatment-as-usual' alone in reducing psychological distress and enhancing psychological well-being; (2) outcomes would differ according to intervention; and (3) combining the interventions would be more effective than delivering either alone. MethodsWe recruited 40 women in a special Hong Kong prison unit for female offenders with psychological distress. Half of them received eight sessions of CBT followed by eight sessions of PPI; the other half received the same interventions in the reverse order. We recruited another 35 women who received only treatment as usual' (TAU) in the same unit. We used various clinical scales to assess the women's psychological distress or well-being before and after the interventions or at similar time points for the comparison women. ResultsAll intervention group women showed a significant reduction in psychological distress and enhancement in psychological well-being after each intervention alone compared to the TAU women. There were no significant differences between CBT and PPI in this respect. Receiving both treatments, however, did yield significantly more improvement than either intervention alone in reducing depressive thoughts and enhancing global judgement of life satisfaction, self-perceived strengths and hopeful thinking style. Conclusions and implication for practiceOur findings provide preliminary empirical support for the effectiveness of psychological interventions with psychologically distressed women in prison. It would be important now to conduct a full, randomised trial to determine optimal length and combinations of treatment.

The present research tested the hypothesis that affirming conflicting groups' agency would increase their members' mutual prosociality. The effectiveness of agency affirmation was demonstrated in three contexts of conflict between groups: Switzerland and the EU following the 2014 referendum (Study 1), Israelis and Palestinians (Study 2), and Israeli rightists and leftists (Study 3). Study 1 found that in a nonconflictual context Swiss participants prioritized their moral (prosocial) over agentic goals, yet in the context of conflict with the EU, they prioritized their agentic over moral goals. This primacy-of-agency effect, however, was eliminated once their ingroup's agency was affirmed. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated the positive effect of agency affirmation on prosociality among Israelis referring to Palestinians and Israeli rightists and leftists referring to the adversarial political camp. This effect was mediated by group members' readiness to relinquish some power for the sake of morality. Pointing to the importance of the affirmation's specific content, Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that morality affirmation failed to increase prosociality. As such, the present research puts forward a promising strategy to reduce hostility and promote prosociality between conflicting groups.","2018-04","2018-12-21 16:23:23","2018-12-21 16:23:23","","445-463","","2","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agency; group affirmation; intergroup conflict; morality; prosociality; the needs-based model of reconciliation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One possible reason is that altered dopamine or glutamate activity in schizophrenia enhances the reinforcing effectiveness of nicotine. Weused animal models to test the hypothesis that a hyperdopaminergic state (induced by repeated intermittent injections of amphetamine) or altered glutamate function (subchronic injection of phencyclidine, PCP) facilitates spontaneous acquisition of nicotine self-administration in rats. In Experiment 1 animals in an amphetamine-induced sensitized state (AISS) did not differ from saline-injected controls in their acquisition and maintenance of nicotine self-administration. This effect was replicated in experiment 2, but it was also found that AISS rats and salineinjected controls showed higher rates of nicotine self-administration compared to uninjected controls. This difference was maintained across several fixed ratio and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement. In Experiment 3 PCP treated rats and their saline-injected controls did not differ in nicotine self-administration. However, both groups showed consistently increased responding for nicotine on FR and PR schedules compared to an uninjected control group. Injection-stress appeared to influence the outcomes of these experiments in two ways. Firstly, injection stress potentially masked the impact of the AISS and PCP treatment on nicotine self-administration. Secondly, injection stress itself may have been sufficient to induce plastic changes in dopamine and glutamate systems, and these changes enhanced the acquisition and maintenance of nicotine self-administration. Further investigation is needed into the role of stress in the development of nicotine use and dependence, in the aetiology of schizophrenia and in their co-morbidity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As little research has evaluated individual differences beyond anger in this association, this research examines problematic drinking and IPV perpetration through the lens of self-determination theory (SDT), the relational perspective suggesting individuals are motivated to be in their relationship for autonomous (i.e., self-driven) and controlled (i.e., guilt-driven) reasons. We test the hypothesis that problematic drinking is more strongly associated with IPV among those who are controlled in their motivation in four independent samples (N = 617). College students in relationships completed measures of alcohol consumption, negative alcohol-related consequences, relationship motivation, and IPV perpetration. Results generally suggested that the association between both alcohol consumption and negative alcohol-related consequences and IPV perpetration is only significant among those endorsing greater controlled motivation. This study supports problematic drinking as not being an equal risk factor for all individuals, and suggests that some people may be more vulnerable to problematic drinking resulting in relationship aggression.","2018-04","2018-12-21 16:23:24","2018-12-21 16:23:24","","225-235","","2","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alcohol; College students; Partner abuse; Relationship motivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used theoretical codings of situational change and human perceptions of event boundaries to predict mind wandering in 5-s intervals. Our findings suggest a temporal alignment between the structural dynamics of the film and mind wandering reports. Specifically, the number of situational changes and likelihood of perceiving event boundaries in the prior 0-15 s interval negatively predicted mind wandering net of low-level audiovisual features. Thus, mind wandering is less likely to occur when there is more event change, suggesting that narrative shifts keep attention from drifting inwards.","2018-04","2018-12-21 16:23:25","2018-12-21 16:23:25","","133-137","","","173","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention; Event cognition; Film comprehension; Mind wandering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The neurophysiology of sensory memory decay rate has rarely been examined in the context of speech processing. In a lexical tone study, we showed that long-term memory representation of lexical tone slows the decay rate of sensory memory for these tones. Here, we tested the hypothesis that long-term memory representation of vowels slows the rate of auditory sensory memory decay in a similar way to that of lexical tone. Event-related potential (ERP) responses were recorded to Mandarin non-words contrasting the vowels /i/vs. /u/ and /y/vs. /u/ from first-language (L1) Mandarin and L1 American English participants under short and long interstimulus interval (ISI) conditions (short ISI: an average of 575 ms, long ISI: an average of 2675 ms). Results revealed poorer discrimination of the vowel contrasts for English listeners than Mandarin listeners, but with different patterns for behavioral perception and neural discrimination. As predicted, English listeners showed the poorest discrimination and identification for the vowel contrast /y/ vs. /u/, and poorer performance in the long ISI condition. In contrast to Yu et al. (2017), however, we found no effect of ISI reflected in the neural responses, specifically the mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a and late negativity ERP amplitudes. We did see a language group effect, with Mandarin listeners generally showing larger MMN and English listeners showing larger P3a. The behavioral results revealed that native language experience plays a role in echoic sensory memory trace maintenance, but the failure to find an effect of ISI on the ERP results suggests that vowel and lexical tone memory traces decay at different rates. Highlights: We examined the interaction between auditory sensory memory decay and language experience. We compared MMN, P3a, LN and behavioral responses in short vs. long interstimulus intervals. We found that different from lexical tone contrast, MMN, P3a, and LN changes to vowel contrasts are not influenced by lengthening the ISI to 2.6 s. We also found that the English listeners discriminated the non-native vowel contrast with lower accuracy under the long ISI condition.","2018-03-22","2018-12-21 16:23:25","2018-12-21 16:23:25","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","event-related potentials; interstimulus interval; late negativity; mismatch negativity; P3a novelty; sensory memory decay; speech perception; vowel processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives. - Our objective was to test the hypothesis that employees in Pakistan (i.e., an underdeveloped economy) would be more focused on rewards than procedures. Therefore, procedural and distributive justice will not interact in predicting employee behaviors. Methods. - Using independent measures for organizational justice and job outcomes, we conducted two field surveys (n = 372 and n = 550 paired responses) in Pakistan to examine the direct and combined effects of procedural and distributive justice on job performance, citizenship behaviors, and creativity. Results. - In both studies, the results suggest that distributive justice is a more consistent and relatively stronger predictor of job outcomes as compared to procedural justice. The results also showed that procedural justice did not moderate the relationship between distributive justice and employee behaviors. Conclusion. - The findings suggest that workers in an underdeveloped economy like Pakistan may be more concerned with fairness in the distribution of rewards than procedural fairness. Therefore, in such context, procedures may be less likely to reduce negative consequences of unfair reward distribution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Sixty participants read sentences, and ERP effects of semantic anomaly, relative to plausible words, were calculated for each participant. Results suggested qualitatively different ERP patterns across participants: Some individuals generated N400-dominated effects, whereas others generated P600-dominated effects, for the same stimuli. To specify the sources of individual differences in brain responses, we also derived aggregate scores for verbal working memory (WM), nonverbal WM, and language experience/knowledge, based on 6 behavioral measures administered to each participant. Multiple regression analysis pitting these 3 constructs against each other showed that a larger verbal WM capacity was significantly associated with larger P600 and smaller N400 effect amplitudes across individuals, whereas the other constructs did not predict the ERP effects. The results suggest that N400 and P600 brain responses, which may be attributable to semantic integration difficulty and structural processing, respectively, vie for expression when comprehenders encounter semantically unexpected words and that which option wins out is constrained in part by each comprehender's verbal WM capacity.","2018-03","2018-12-21 16:23:26","2018-12-21 16:23:26","","406-420","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","event-related potentials (ERPs); individual differences; sentence comprehension; working memory capacity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Path analysis was conducted to test the hypothesized model. Results: The overall and specific indirect effects of social constraints on depressive symptoms through AEE, avoidance, intrusive thoughts, and social support are significant. When the mediators are controlled for, the direct effect of social constraints on depressive symptoms is no longer significant.

Behavioral evidence shows that conflict control occurs over successive trials as well as longer time scales of trial blocks, but the relation among time scales as well as their neural mechanisms are unclear. This study used measures of behavior, EEG, and a simple quantitative model to test the hypothesis that conflict control at the block level is not exclusively driven by control adjustments over successive trials. Young adults performed an auditory Simon task, and the base rate of compatible vs. incompatible trials was manipulated in separate blocks (25, 50, 75% compatible). EEG data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) to define cortical mechanisms of any base rate and trial-by-trial sequence effects. Reaction time measures had both sequence and base rate effects. Two fronto-medial ICA components indexed sequence and base rate effects, with specific profiles for evoked potentials and oscillations in the theta and alpha frequency bands. Predictive modeling showed that sequence effects accounted for a minority of the variance on behavioral and ICA measures (all < 36%). The results strongly suggest that the base rate manipulation affected behavior and many neural measures beyond the influence of sequence effects.","2018-03","2018-12-21 16:23:27","2018-12-21 16:23:27","","216-228","","","111","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention; Cognitive control; EEG; Theta Prefrontal cortex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our prior work, we found that ACEs predicted reductions in the volume of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a brain region important for impulse control and emotion regulation. Here we tested the hypothesis that ACES might influence child behavioral outcomes through an impact on IFG functional connectivity, which may influence impulsive or risk-taking behavior. Method: We examined the effects of prospectively assessed ACEs on IFG connectivity in childhood, and their relationship to the trajectory of subsequent psychopathology from late school age and early adolescence, using data from an 11-year longitudinal study of children starting in preschool that included 3 waves of resting state functional connectivity across childhood and early adolescence. Results: ACEs predicted functional connectivity of both left and right IFG. Multi-level modeling of symptoms across 3 waves of assessments indicated that more ACEs predicted both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, altered IFG connectivity specifically predicted greater externalizing symptoms over time in middle childhood and early adolescence, as compared to internalizing symptoms. Longitudinal modeling indicating that the relationships between externalizing and functional connectivity were maintained across 3 waves of functional connectivity assessment. Conclusion: These findings underscore the relationship of ACEs to later psychopathology, and suggest that connectivity of the IFG, a region known to play an important role in impulse control and emotion regulation, may play a key role in the risk trajectory of ACEs to externalizing problems. However, further work is needed to understand whether these relationships reflect a direct effect of ACEs or whether ACEs are a marker for other environmental or genetic factors that may also influence brain development and behavior.","2018-03","2018-12-21 16:23:29","2018-12-21 16:23:29","","183-190","","3","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","development; externalizing; functional connectivity; inferior frontal gyrus; longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 16-week group-based worksite intervention was designed based on the tenets of SDT combined with techniques from motivational interviewing (MI). Participants were assessed at baseline and at post-test five months later. Results: Complete-case analyses applying multivariate and univariate analysis of variance indicated an overall intervention effect, and moderate to small effect sizes (Cohen's d) in favour of the intervention group on CRF, diastolic BP, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as need support for PA, autonomous motivation for PA, and perceived competence for PA. Intention-to-treat analyses demonstrated the same pattern with smaller effect sizes. Path analysis obtained a good fit between the data and the SDT model of health behaviour change. Conclusions: Offering need supportive interventions to enhance autonomous motivation and competence for PA among employees resulted in important improvements in CRF as well as positive changes in health.

Research suggests that young adults are commonly exposed to e-cigarette-related marketing or user-generated content on the social media they use. Currently, however, there is limited empirical evidence as to how social media e-cigarette exposure is associated with e-cigarette use beliefs and behavior. In particular, limited evidence exists to support the proposition that social media e-cigarette exposure is uniquely associated with e-cigarette use, even after adjusting for the effects of e-cigarette use in young adults' in-person or `offline' social networks. This study was conducted to test the hypotheses that 1) social media e-cigarette exposure is associated with e-cigarette use outcome expectancies and current e-cigarette use; and 2) the association between social media and e-cigarette use is linked via outcome expectancies. We collected cross-sectional data from a sample of 470 young adult college students in Hawaii. Hypotheses were tested by fitting a structural equation model to the data. The model accounted for the associations of demographic variables, cigarette smoking history, as well as e-cigarette use in individuals' actual social networks with expectancies and behavior. Results indicated that social media e-cigarette exposure was associated with current e-cigarette use indirectly through two of the four positive outcome expectancies examined, namely, positive “smoking” experience and positive sensory experience. We discuss the implications of the findings in the context of tobacco control efforts.","2018-03","2018-12-21 16:23:31","2018-12-21 16:23:31","","51-58","","","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","E-cigarettes; Expectancies; Social media; Young adults","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether EOT mediates the association of drinking with these deficits, and to test the hypothesis that impaired facial emotion recognition mediates the relationship between EOT and low emotional empathy, in a nonclinical sample. The sample consisted of 161 men and women who completed an online survey that included the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). In addition to replicating associations between TAS-20 and other measures, EOT was found to mediate relationships between potential alcohol misuse (as indexed by AUDIT) and facial emotion recognition (as indexed by RMET) as well as emotional empathy (as indexed by the corresponding subscale of the IRI) after controlling for mood and demographic variables. The negative relationship between EOT and emotional empathy was mediated by impaired facial emotion recognition. Present findings point to a likely role of the EOT trait in the reported associations of alcohol misuse with both poor emotion recognition and low emotional empathy, and a mediating role of poor emotion recognition in the relationship of EOT to the latter.","2018","2018-12-21 16:23:32","2018-12-21 16:23:32","","41-51","","1","131","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol; alexithymia; emotion; empathy; personality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to validate the Setswana version of the original 30-item long form of the Stress Overload Scale as well as the 10-item short form (Stress Overload Scale-Short Form), both evaluating experienced personal vulnerability and external event load. A sample of N=376 adults living in a rural community in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa were randomly selected to partake in the study. Emerging model fit indices of confirmatory factor analysis testing the hypothesized two-factor structure of the original Stress Overload Scale were not convincingly good. However, we found a remarkable improvement in model fit indices in the case of the Stress Overload Scale-Short Form. Concurrent validity was shown for the Stress Overload Scale-Short Form in significant correlations with depression and emotional well-being. We conclude that the Setswana version of the Stress Overload Scale-Short Form is a psychometrically sound instrument for measuring stress in the present context; however, further validation of the original Stress Overload Scale in diverse samples is necessary to provide stronger support for the hypothesized two-factor structure.","2018-03","2018-12-21 16:23:32","2018-12-21 16:23:32","","21-31","","1","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Northern Cape Province; psychometric properties; South Africa; stress; Stress Overload Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This prospective mode of planning has been termed second-order planning. Surprisingly, second-order planning is thought to be fully developed only by 10 years of age, when children master seemingly more complex motor skills. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that already 5- and 6-year-old children consistently use second-order planning but that this ability does not become apparent in tasks that are traditionally used to probe it. We asked 5- and 6-year-olds and adults to grasp and rotate a circular dial in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Although children's grasp selections were less consistent on an intra- and inter-individual level than adults' grasp selections, all children adjusted their grasps to the upcoming dial rotations. By contrast, in an also administered bar rotation task, only a subset of children adjusted their grasps to different bar rotations, thereby replicating previous results. The results indicate that 5- and 6-year-olds consistently use second-order planning in a dial rotation task, although this ability does not become apparent in bar rotation tasks.

To investigate lay-offs from the perspective of those who are affected, we conducted a lagged study examining lay-off victims' experiences of supervisory justice, top management justice, and organizational support. We test the hypotheses that the relationships between supervisory justice and lay-off victims' subsequent experiences of top management justice as well as organizational support are moderated by supervisors' prototypicality of their team. Results from our study conducted during lay-off process indicated that supervisory justice had a positive lagged impact on lay-off victims' unfolding experiences of both (1) top management justice and (2) organizational support for supervisors who were viewed as highly (but not lowly) prototypical of the team that both supervisors and subordinates were part of. Our study identifies a theoretically grounded moderator that may account for the presence (or absence) of cross-foci effects found in previous multifoci justice studies. Moreover, our results shed light on the development of justice perceptions by demonstrating the impact of lower-level supervisors in translating subordinates' perceptions of justice of the supervisor to that of the top management. Findings suggest that supervisors have an important role to play in managing (for better or worse) the potentially harmful consequences associated with organizational redundancies.","2018-03","2018-12-21 16:23:33","2018-12-21 16:23:33","","158-180","","1","91","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","fairness; justice; layoff; leader prototypicality; leadership; perceived organizational support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One reason for this might be that many tasks currently used to assess morphological knowledge require children to inflect or derive real words in the language, thus recruiting their vocabulary knowledge. The current study investigated the possible separability of lexical and morphological knowledge using two complementary approaches. First, we examined the correlations between vocabulary and four morphological tasks tapping different aspects of morphological processing and awareness, and using either real-word or pseudo-word stimuli. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that different morphological tasks recruit lexical knowledge to various degrees. Second, we compared the Hebrew vocabulary and morphological knowledge of 5th grade language minority speaking children to that of their native speaking peers. This comparison allows us to ask whether reduced exposure to the societal language might differentially influence vocabulary and morphological knowledge. The results demonstrate that indeed different morphological tasks rely on lexical knowledge to varying degrees. In addition, language minority students had significantly lower performance in vocabulary and in morphological tasks that recruited vocabulary knowledge to a greater extent. In contrast, both groups performed similarly in abstract morphological tasks with a lower vocabulary load. These results demonstrate that lexical and morphological knowledge may rely on partially separable learning mechanisms, and highlight the importance of distinguishing between these two linguistic components.","2018-02-21","2018-12-21 16:23:34","2018-12-21 16:23:34","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bilingual; language-minority; lexical knowledge; morphology; token; type; vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The type 1 corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF1) receptor has received much attention for its putative role in the progression to alcohol dependence, although at present its success in clinical trials has been limited. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the rat Crhr1 promoter have been identified in the Marchigian substrain of Sardinian alcohol-preferring (msP) rats. Unlike other Wistar-derived alcohol-preferring lines, nondependent msP rats reduce their alcohol self-administration in response to CRF1 antagonists and show increased brain CRF1 expression. The current study tested the hypotheses that the A alleles in the Crhr1 promoter polymorphisms are: (1) unique to msP (vs. CRF1 antagonist-insensitive) alcohol-preferring lines and (2) associate with greater alcohol preference or intake. Two related polymorphisms were observed in which both loci on a given chromosome were either mutant variant (A) or wild-type (G) alleles within the distal Crhr1 promoter of 17/25 msP rats (68%), as compared to 0/23 Indiana P rats, 0/20 Sardinian alcohol-preferring rats bred at Scripps (Scr: sP) and 0/21 outbred Wistar rats. Alcohol consumption in msP rats did not differ according to the presence of Crhr1 A alleles, but greater alcohol preference (98%) was observed in A allele homozygous msP rats (AA) compared to msP rats with wild-type (GG, 91%) or heterozygous (GA, 91%) genotypes. The greater alcohol preference reflected decreased water intake, accompanied by reduced total calories consumed by AA rats. The data show that msP rats differentially possess mutant A variant alleles in the polymorphic promoter region of the Crhr1 gene that may differentially regulate consumption.","2018-02-15","2018-12-21 16:23:35","2018-12-21 16:23:35","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol; corticotropin-releasing factor; corticotropin-releasing hormone; ethanol; genetic vulnerability; promoter; selective breeding; single-nucleotide polymorphism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirical Evidences for Spatial Bias in Intergroup Differentiation","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00152","","Social categorization is the differentiation between the self and others and between one's own group and other groups and it is such a natural and spontaneous process that often we are not aware of it. The way in which the brain organizes social categorization remains an unresolved issue. We present three experiments investigating the hypothesis that social categories are mentally ordered from left to right on an ingroup-outgroup continuum when membership is salient. To substantiate our hypothesis, we consider empirical evidence from two areas of psychology: research on differences in processing of ingroups and outgroups and research on the effects of spatial biases on processing of quantitative information (e.g., time; numbers) which appears to be arranged from left to right on a small-large continuum, an effect known as the spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC). In Experiments 1 and 2 we tested the hypothesis that when membership of a social category is activated, people implicitly locate ingroup categories to the left of a mental line whereas outgroup categories are located on the far right of the same mental line. This spatial organization persists even when stimuli are presented on one of the two sides of the screen and their (explicit) position is spatially incompatible with the implicit mental spatial organization of social categories (Experiment 3). Overall the results indicate that ingroups and outgroups are processed differently. The results are discussed with respect to social categorization theory, spatial agency bias, i.e., the effect observed in Western cultures whereby the agent of an action is mentally represented on the left and the recipient on the right, and the SNARC effect.","2018-02-15","2018-12-21 16:23:35","2018-12-21 16:23:35","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ingroup-outgroup; SNARC effect; social categorization; spatial agency bias; spatial biases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though there are well-known personal, familial, and social factors associated with drug use, less is known about the effect of school-related factors. School membership is a recognized variable affecting academic performance among students; however, its effect on substance use is less understood. Aims: The primary aim of this study was to explore the association between school membership and cigarette, alcohol, and cannabis use among a representative sample of secondary students from municipal state-funded schools in Santiago of Chile, and secondly, to test the hypothesis that depressive or anxiety symptoms mediate this association. Methods: A total of 2,508 students from 22 state-funded schools in Santiago, Chile, answered a questionnaire. This instrument included an abbreviated version of the psychological sense of school membership (PSSM), questions regarding the use of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis and scales of psychological functioning (depression, anxiety, self-concept, and problem-solving). The association analyses were performed using adjusted regression models for each outcome using all independent variables while controlling for gender and age. For the mediation effect, a combination of ordinary least square and logistic regression analyses was conducted. Results: There was an association between a strong PSSM and low risk for smoking (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.46-0.72), drinking (0.65; 95% CI: 0.51-0.83), and cannabis use (0.52; 95% CI 0.37-0.74). We also found that depressive and anxiety symptoms do not fully mediate the association between school membership and any substance use, and 73% of this effect in the case of smoking, 80% in the case of drinking, and 78.5% in the case of cannabis use, was direct. Conclusion: This is the first study in Latin America exploring the association between school membership and substance use among secondary students. School membership seems to be an important and independent factor to be included in preventive interventions. Therefore, these results support future research aiming to test interventions at increasing the sense of school membership to prevent substance use among adolescents.","2018-02-08","2018-12-21 16:23:36","2018-12-21 16:23:36","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; anxiety; depression; mental health; school membership; substance abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although much previous research has addressed such putative language perception causality, no firm proof is available thus far which demonstrates that verbal labels help or otherwise influence perceptual processes. Here, we tested the hypothesis of language perception causality by using novel, minimally-different tactile-patterned stimuli applied to the finger, which initially could not be discriminated by our participants. By combining novel verbal pseudoword- and novel tactile-patterned stimuli in an implicit learning experiment, we show a language-induced facilitation in tactile-patterned stimulus discrimination. After one week of intensive yet implicit learning of tactile stimuli in the presence of irrelevant consistent verbal labels, participants demonstrated significant discrimination improvement. In contrast, the same participants showed no improvement in discriminating tactile patterned stimuli that had been learnt in the context of variable linguistic stimuli. These results show that specific mental links between verbal labels and perceptual information brought about by their correlated presentation enable one to better discriminate said sensory information (and build percepts).","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:37","2018-12-21 16:23:37","","172-179","","","171","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hebbian learning; Language; Linguistic relativity; Perception; Tactile perception; Whorf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also tested whether the association between parental alcohol problems and self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempt among young people differed depending on the gender of the child and the parent. Data came from the Danish National Youth Study 2014, a web-based national survey. A total of 75,853 high school and vocational school students participated. Self-injury, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts were outcomes and the main exposure variables were perceived parental alcohol problems, gender of the parent with alcohol problems, cohabitation with a parent with alcohol problems, and severity of the parents' alcohol problems. Young people with parental alcohol problems had higher odds of self-injury [boys: OR = 1.59 (95% CI 1.40-1.82); girls: OR = 1.84 (95% CI 1.69-1.99)], suicidal ideation [boys: OR = 1.81 (95% CI 1.59-2.06); girls: OR 1.74 (95% CI 1.59-1.89)], and suicide attempt [boys: OR = 2.10 (95% CI 1.63-2.71); girls: OR = 2.09 (95% CI 1.80-2.42)] compared to young people without parental alcohol problems.

In ultra-high risk individuals (UHR) increased NS was reported recently, pointing towards dynamic alterations of the underlying pathomechanisms in the period preceding psychosis. However, these characteristics are still unresolved in the diverse UHR groups. We tested the hypothesis that NS is attenuated in patients who have transitioned to psychosis and in the Brief Limited Intermittent Psychotic Symptoms (BLIPS, UHR-B) and/or the attenuated symptoms (UHR-A) groups, while it is unchanged or increased in the genetic risk group (UHR-G). Sensitivity to three concentrations (0.1-0.001 M) of aqueous methylnicotinate was tested in 84 UHR patients, 105 first-episode psychosis patients (FEP) and 180 healthy individuals (HC), using optical reflection spectroscopy (ORS). The UHR subgroup and transition/non-transition outcomes were assessed according to PACE criteria using the CAARMS. Psychopathology was assessed using SANS, SAPS, and BPRS or SCL-90-R self-ratings. In 0.001 M data, decreased NS was found in the UHR-B (n = 12), UHR-A (n = 45) and the transition groups (n = 13), similar to the result in FEP. NS in the UHR-G (n = 27) and HC groups did not differ. In the UHR-B and FEP groups, NS and positive symptom scores were inversely correlated. These state marker properties could be used to characterize the intensity of the underlying pathomechanisms during the onset of psychosis or to identify UHR individuals that might benefit from related indicated prevention strategies.

We tested the hypothesis of right cerebral hemisphere specialization for balance control. Groups of damage either to the right (RHD, n = 9) or the left (LHD, n = 7) cerebral hemisphere were compared across tasks requiring quiet balance or body balance recovery following a mechanical perturbation, comparing them to age-matched nondisabled individuals (controls, n = 24). They were evaluated in conditions of full and occluded vision. In Experiment 1, the groups were compared in the task of quiet standing on (A) rigid and (B) malleable surfaces, having as outcome measures center of pressure (CoP) amplitude and velocity sway. In Experiment 2, we evaluated the recovery of body balance following a perturbation inducing forward body oscillation, having as outcome measures CoP displacement, peak hip and ankle rotations and muscular activation of both legs. Results from Experiment 1 showed higher values of CoP sway velocity for RHD in comparison to LHD and controls in the anteroposterior (rigid surface) and mediolateral (malleable surface) directions, while LHD had lower balance stability than the controls only in the mediolateral direction when supported on the rigid surface. In Experiment 2 results showed that RHD led to increased values in comparison to LHD and controls for anteroposterior CoP displacement and velocity, time to CoP direction reversion, hip rotation, and magnitude of muscular activation in the paretic leg, while LHD was found to differ in comparison to controls in magnitude of muscular activation of the paretic leg and amplitude of mediolateral sway only. These results suggest that damage to the right as compared to the left cerebral hemisphere by stroke leads to poorer postural responses both in quiet and perturbed balance. That effect was not altered by manipulation of sensory information. Our findings suggest that the right cerebral hemisphere plays a more prominent role in efferent processes responsible for balance control.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:39","2018-12-21 16:23:39","","374-387","","","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cerebral hemisphere damage; Inter-hemispheric asymmetry; Perturbed balance; Sensory manipulation; Upright balance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tested the hypothesis that the ProblemSolving Adherence (PSA) intervention, which integrates problem-solving into adherence enhancement procedures, reduces dyspnea-related disability more than PID-C. Exploratory analyses sought to identify patients with distinct dyspnea-related disability trajectories and to compare their clinical profiles. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial in an acute inpatient rehabilitation and community, 101 participants diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and major depression were included after screening 633 consecutive admissions for acute inpatient rehabilitation. Participants underwent 14 sessions of PID-C versus PSA over 26 weeks using the Pulmonary Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire. Results: The study hypothesis was not supported. Exploratory latent class growth modeling identified two distinct disability trajectories. Dyspnea-related disability improved in 39% of patients and remained unchanged in the rest. Patients whose dyspnea-related disability improved had more severe disability and less sense of control over their condition at baseline. Conclusion: Improvement or no worsening of disability was noted in both treatment groups. This is a favorable course for depressed patients with a severe, deteriorating medical illness. PID-C is compatible with the expertise of clinicians working in community-based rehabilitation programs, and after further testing in the community, it can be integrated in the care of depressed COPD patients.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:40","2018-12-21 16:23:40","","162-171","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","clinical trial; COPD; disability; dyspnea; Geriatric depression; personalized intervention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, at present no study has systematically investigated the relationships among these factors and how these mediating mechanisms work. To address this gap, path analyses are conducted to test the hypothesized pathways whereby parental religious involvement operates to discourage delinquent behaviors of offspring. The study variables are taken from three waves of the study of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and its descendent NLSY79 Child and Young Adults at two year intervals (2000, 2002, and 2004). 1020 American adolescents who are 10-14 years old in 2002 are selected for final analyses. The findings suggest that parental religious involvement does not affect adolescent delinquency four years later directly, but indirectly through its influence on adolescent religious involvement, parenting practices, inter parental conflict, and their interactions with adolescent self-control.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:41","2018-12-21 16:23:41","","175-190","","","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Delinquency; Family process; Path analysis; Religious involvement; Self-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have shown that patients with FM display a pattern of selective processing or cognitive bias which fosters the encoding of pain-related information. The present study tested the hypothesis of an increased attribution of pain to facial expressions of emotions (FEE), in patients with FM. As previous studies have shown that alexithymia influences the processing of facial expressions, independent of specific clinical conditions, we also investigated whether alexithymia, rather than FM per se, influenced attribution of pain to FEE. Methods: One hundred and twenty-three women (41 with FM, 82 healthy controls, HC) were enrolled in this cross-sectional case-control study. We adopted two pain-attribution tasks, the Emotional Pain Estimation and the Emotional Pain Ascription, both using a modified version of the Ekman 60 Faces Test. Psychological distress was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and alexithymia was assessed using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: Patients with FM did not report increased attribution of pain to FEE. Alexithymic individuals demonstrated no specific problem in the recognition of basic emotions, but attributed significantly more pain to angry facial expression. Limitations: Our study involved a relatively small sample size. The use of self-reported instruments might have led to underestimation of the presence of frank alexithymia in individuals having borderline cut-off scores. Conclusions: Alexithymia, rather than FM per se, plays a key role in explaining the observed differences in pain attribution to anger-related facial expressions.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:41","2018-12-21 16:23:41","","272-279","","","227","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alexithymia; Anger; Emotion recognition; Fibromyalgia; Pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tailoring treatment to traumatized young children requires understanding the different patterns of trauma-related symptomatology and important correlates. The current study tested the hypothesis that type and number of child traumatic events, caregiver trauma exposure, and caregiver symptomatology would predict whether traumatized young children presented with PTSD, PTSD with clinical dissociation, or non-clinical trauma symptoms. Methods: A multinomial regression was conducted using data collected from an ethnically and economically diverse sample of 297 trauma-exposed children between the ages of 3 and 6 and their caregivers. Based on parent-report on a well-validated measure of trauma symptoms, children were categorized into three groups: non-clinical (n = 128), PTSD only (n = 104), or PTSD with dissociation (PTSD-DISS; n = 65). Predictors included trauma exposure, parent trauma symptoms, and child sex. Results: Girls were twice more likely than boys to be in the PTSD-DISS group; sexually abused children were almost three times as likely to be in the PTSD-DISS group; and, for every unit increase in parent avoidance symptoms or number of traumatic events, the odds of being in the PTSD-DISS group increased significantly. Limitations: Given the cross-sectional study design, conclusions cannot be drawn regarding causality. Measures were completed by a single reporter. Conclusions: Findings suggest that subgroups of children may be especially vulnerable to comorbid PTSD and dissociation. Implications for treatment are discussed.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:42","2018-12-21 16:23:42","","536-541","","","227","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Dissociation; Early childhood; Interpersonal trauma; Post-traumatic stress disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This word length effect has been the cornerstone of the working memory model and a benchmark effect that all models of immediate memory should account for. Currently, there is no consensus as to what determines the word length effect. Jalbert and colleagues (Jalbert, Neath, Bireta, & Surprenant, 2011a; Jalbert, Neath, & Surprenant, 2011b) suggested that neighborhood size is one causal factor. In six experiments we systematically examined their suggestion. In Experiment 1, with an immediate serial recall task, multiple word lengths, and a large pool of words controlled for neighborhood size, the typical word length effect was present. In Experiments 2 and 3, with an order reconstruction task and words with either many or few neighbors, we observed the typical word length effect. In Experiment 4 we tested the hypothesis that the previous abolition of the word length effect when neighborhood size was controlled was due to a confounded factor: frequency of orthographic structure. As predicted, we reversed the word length effect when using short words with less frequent orthographic structures than the long words, as was done in both of Jalbert et al.'s studies. In Experiments 5 and 6, we again observed the typical word length effect, even if we controlled for neighborhood size and frequency of orthographic structure. Overall, the results were not consistent with the predictions of Jalbert et al. and clearly showed a large and reliable word length effect after controlling for neighborhood size.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:42","2018-12-21 16:23:42","","244-260","","2","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Immediate serial recall; Word length effect; Working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current research tested the hypothesis that women engage in more comfortable and intimate interactions with a gay (but not a straight) man immediately after discovering his sexual orientation. In two studies, female participants engaged in imagined or actual initial interactions with either a straight man or a gay man. After the man's sexual orientation was revealed, women (particularly attractive ones) who were paired with a gay man reported greater anticipated comfort, which was mediated by their reduced worry about his sexual intentions (Study 1). Further, once women discovered that they were interacting with a gay man, they displayed more intimate engagement behaviors with him (Study 2). These findings reveal how, and why, close relationships often form quickly between women and gay men.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:43","2018-12-21 16:23:43","","288-303","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","heterosexual women; homosexual men; initial interactions; open data; open materials; opposite-sex friendship; sexual attraction; sexual orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AimsOur aim was to test the hypothesis that higher self-rated psychopathology would be associated with lower QoL among adolescents resident within youth correctional facilities in Lagos. MethodsPsychopathology was assessed using the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ), while QoL was measured by using the Paediatric Quality of Life. ResultsOne hundred and sixty-five adolescents completed the study, mostly boys (n=124; 75%) with a mean age of 14.32.1years. Nearly, a fifth (30, 18%) of respondents had abnormal total SDQ scores (17), suggestive of definite psychiatric disorder, while another 44 (27%) had highly probable psychopathology (total SDQ scores 15-16). There was strong negative correlation (r=-0.51, p<0.001) between total SDQ scores and overall self-reported QoL among respondents. Conclusions and implications for practiceAlthough we were unable to infer direction of relationship between psychopathology and QoL among these adolescents, it is plausible to suppose that treatment of mental health problems could have a positive impact on rehabilitation and reintegration. Given the rate of likely psychopathology, mental health screening within young offender institutions should be routine, and followed, as necessary with full assessment and resultant treatment.

Similarly, tasks that require less mental effort are generally preferred over more mentally demanding alternatives. But what happens when one must choose between tasks that entail different kinds of effort, one mainly physical (e.g., carrying buckets) and the other mainly mental (e.g., counting)? We asked participants to choose between a bucket-carrying task and a counting task. Our participants were less likely to choose the bucket task when it required a long reach rather than a short reach, and our participants were also less likely to choose the bucket task the smaller the final count value. We tested the hypothesis that subjective task durations provided a common currency for comparing the difficulties of the two kinds of tasks. We found that this hypothesis provided a better account of the task choice data than did an account that relied on objective task durations. Our study opens the door to a new problem in the study of attention, perception, and psychophysics-judging the difficulty of different kinds of tasks.

Teacher-child relationships and classroom interactions are both important aspects of children's early classroom experiences, but they are not typically considered together in studies of early childhood classrooms. The bioecological model suggests that both uniquely impact children's development. The objective of this study was to examine the joint impact of individual teacher-child relationships reported by the teacher and observed classroom interactions to identify associations between these and children's outcomes. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth cohort, multiple regression was employed to test the hypothesis that teacher-child relationships and classroom interactions are uniquely related to children's classroom behavior and academic achievement. Further, a moderation model was tested to examine the moderating impact of teacher-child relationships on the association between classroom interactions and children's outcomes. Teacher-child relationships were related to children's concurrent academic achievement and classroom behavior, and to children's classroom behavior assessed one year later. No main effects of classroom interactions were identified; however, teacher-child relationships moderated the associations between classroom interactions and children's preschool classroom behavior. Findings suggest that teacher-child relationships are important for children's development in classrooms, even after accounting for classroom interactions. Professional development for teachers and measurement in classroom research should address teacher-child relationships in addition to classroom interactions.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:45","2018-12-21 16:23:45","","1-21","","1","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Preschool; Teacher-child interactions; Teacher-child relationships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to further investigate this distinction by investigating the associations between the two types of MW and two dispositional sub-types of self-consciousness, namely, self-rumination and self-reflection. Specifically, we specified a structural equation model in order to test the hypotheses that (1) self-rumination predicts spontaneous mind-wandering over and above neuroticism, and (2) self-reflection predicts deliberate mind-wandering over and above need for cognition (i.e., the tendency for an individual to engage in and enjoy thinking). Data were collected on 252 online participants. We found that while the spontaneous and deliberate MW were positively associated with each other, spontaneous MW was uniquely positively predicted by self-rumination, over and above neuroticism, whereas deliberate MW was uniquely positively predicted by self-reflection, over and above need for cognition. These results provide further support for the distinction between the two types of MW and suggest specific motivational dispositions for doing spontaneous and deliberate MW.","2018-01-15","2018-12-21 16:23:47","2018-12-21 16:23:47","","57-61","","","121","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Deliberate mind wandering; Mind wandering; Neuroticism; Self-consciousness; Self-reflection; Self-rumination; Spontaneous mind wandering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The “sadness” group shared the same sociodemographic patterns as the “MDD” group. All psychiatric disorders assessed (i.e. bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder, psychotic disorder and suicide attempts) were significantly associated with both “sadness” and “MDD” groups compared to “controls”. Individuals with sadness, compared to those with MDD, were significantly less likely to meet the criteria for all psychiatric disorders. MDD's sensitivity of sadness was 94,2%. Limitations: Even though we used a quota sampling method, the sample was not strictly representative of the general population. Conclusion: Sadness validates the depressive continuum hypothesis, since it is more frequent in the general population than MDD itself and at the same time shares with MDD the same sociodemographic and clinical correlates. A gradual association from controls to MDD was observed for psychiatric comorbidities. Finally, the high sensitivity of sadness may suggest its use to screen at-risk individuals converting from well-being to full psychiatric disorders.","2018-01-15","2018-12-21 16:23:48","2018-12-21 16:23:48","","66-71","","","226","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Continuum; Major depressive disorder; Mental disorders; Sadness; Well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying religious influences on behavioral tendency to avoid mortality threats remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis of distinct arousal/attention-related brain responses to self-related information under mortality in nonbelievers and Christians. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from Christians and nonbelievers while they viewed their own names and a stranger's name (i.e., Zuma) that flashed around a cue word (i.e., death, pain or life) located at the center of a screen. While own name vs. a stranger's name induced faster responses and larger P3 amplitudes, the P3 amplitudes to own name showed distinct patterns of modulations by the cue words in nonbelievers and Christians. Specifically, own name elicited larger P3 amplitudes in the death than pain/life cue conditions in nonbelievers but not in Christians. Moreover, the differential P3 amplitude to own names in the death vs. life cue conditions predicted greater inclination to avoid mortality threats in nonbelievers but not in Christians. Our findings provide a neurocognitive account of increased behavioral tendency to avoid mortality threats in nonbelievers than in Christians.","2018-01-08","2018-12-21 16:23:48","2018-12-21 16:23:48","","32-41","","","108","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Arousal; Christian; ERP; Mortality threat; Self","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most common psychiatric disorders in childhood is ADHD, with an estimated prevalence of 3-5% in Sweden. Previous studies have shown a similar prevalence of ADHD in minority and majority children in Sweden and the UK. However, clinical studies demonstrated that children from immigrant families living in Sweden received less psychiatric care than those of native-born parents. We tested the hypothesis that the consumption of child psychiatric care in immigrant families would be determined by the availability of such treatment in the parents' country of origin. Patterns of medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were studied as a proxy for child psychiatric care. Methods: This was a register study of dispensed stimulant medication during 2013-2014 in Swedish national birth cohorts from 1995-2009. The study population, consisting of nearly 1.4 million children, was divided by national income of the parental country of origin and whether the parents were native Swedes, European immigrants, non-European immigrants or a mixture. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios of having been dispensed at least one ADHD drug during 2013, with adjustments for gender, family status indicating whether the child is living with both parents, household income and area of residence. Results: Having parents born in low-income (OR [95% confidence interval] 0.27 [0.24-0.29]) or middle-income (European: OR 0.23 [0.20-0.26], non-European: OR 0.39 [0.34-0.41]) countries was associated with lower ADHD treatment levels than having parents born in high-income countries (European: OR 0.60 [0.54-0.66], non-European: OR 0.68 [0.59-0.79]), when compared to children of parents born in Sweden. In families with a background in low or middle income countries, there was no significant association between household income and ADHD medication, while in children with Swedish and mixed backgrounds high level of disposable income was associated with lower levels of ADHD medication. Conclusion: The use of child psychiatric care by immigrant families in Sweden was largely associated with the income level of the country of origin.","2018-01-08","2018-12-21 16:23:49","2018-12-21 16:23:49","","","","","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; Child mental health services; Health inequalities; Immigrant families; Income levels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Refueling Students in Flight","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02253","","Teachers wishing to offer lessons in nature may hold back for fear of leaving students keyed up and unable to concentrate in subsequent, indoor lessons. This study tested the hypothesis that lessons in nature have positive-not negative-aftereffects on subsequent classroom engagement. Using carefully matched pairs of lessons (one in a relatively natural outdoor setting and one indoors), we observed subsequent classroom engagement during an indoor instructional period, replicating these comparisons over 10 different topics and weeks in the school year, in each of two third grade classrooms. Pairs were roughly balanced in how often the outdoor lesson preceded or followed the classroom lesson. Classroom engagement was significantly better after lessons in nature than after their matched counterparts for four of the five measures developed for this study: teacher ratings; third-party tallies of “redirects” (the number of times the teacher stopped instruction to direct student attention back onto the task at hand); independent, photo-based ratings made blind to condition; and a composite index each showed a nature advantage; student ratings did not. This nature advantage held across different teachers and held equally over the initial and final 5 weeks of lessons. And the magnitude of the advantage was large. In 48 out of 100 paired comparisons, the nature lesson was a full standard deviation better than its classroom counterpart; in 20 of the 48, the nature lesson was over two standard deviations better. The rate of “redirects” was cut almost in half after a lesson in nature, allowing teachers to teach for longer periods uninterrupted. Because the pairs of lessons were matched on teacher, class (students and classroom), topic, teaching style, week of the semester, and time of day, the advantage of the nature-based lessons could not be attributed to any of these factors. It appears that, far from leaving students too keyed up to concentrate afterward, lessons in nature may actually leave students more able to engage in the next lesson, even as students are also learning the material at hand. Such “refueling in flight” argues for including more lessons in nature in formal education.","2018-01-04","2018-12-21 16:23:49","2018-12-21 16:23:49","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","academic achievement; classroom engagement; environmental education; lessons in nature; teaching outdoors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study sought to test how TPB variables interact to predict physical activity (PA) in children. Method: Four hundred thirty-eight children (M-age=8.6 years, SD=1.6years) completed a TPB questionnaire and a PA questionnaire at Time 1. The PA measure was repeated 2months later. Path analyses were performed to test the hypothesized model including interaction terms between TPB variables. Simple slopes analyses were also carried out to examine the statistically significant interaction terms. Results: Path analyses confirmed the classical hypotheses of TPB (R-2 for intentions=.39, R-2 for PA=.12) and also demonstrated only statistically significant Attitudes x Perceived Behavioral Control and Subjective Norms x Attitudes interactions (R-2 change for intentions=.01, p=.009). Simple slopes analyses revealed that the strength of the association between perceived behavioral control and intentions was only statistically significantly higher (t=2.18, p=.05, d=0.34, 95% CI [0.03, 0.65]) when attitudes were high compared with when attitudes were low. The link between attitudes and intentions was only statistically significant at a low level of subjective norms but not at a high level. Conclusion: The integration of interaction effects between TPB variables did not increase for the variance of PA explained by the model. More research appears to be necessary to explore how the TPB could be augmented to better predict PA in children.","2018","2018-12-21 16:23:50","2018-12-21 16:23:50","","490-497","","4","89","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Child health; exercise; psychosocial theories; structural equation modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consistent with our predictions two studies demonstrated that disgust correlates with self-reported sense of smell. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated, from an individual difference perspective, that trait-like differences in disgust relate to self-reported sense of smell. Physical forms of disgust (i.e., sexual and pathogen disgust) drove this association. However, the association between self-reported sense of smell and disgust sensitivity is small, suggesting that it is likely not a good proxy for disgust sensitivity. The results of Study 2 extended this finding by demonstrating that individual differences in self-reported sense of smell influence how individuals react to a disgusting olfactory stimulus. Those who reported having a better sense of smell (or better insight into their olfactory ability) found a disgusting smell significantly more noxious as compared to participants reporting having a poor sense of smell (or poor insight into their olfactory ability). The current findings suggest that a one-item measure of self-reported sense of smell may be an effective tool in disgust research.","2018","2018-12-21 16:23:50","2018-12-21 16:23:50","","191-195","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","disgust; disgust sensitivity; individual differences; olfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that association of MD on day 11 with a saline injection would alter emotional behavior, CORT response, and brain monoamine levels, in male and female adult rats. Rats were submitted to the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF), the sucrose negative contrast test (SNCT), social investigation test (SIT), and the elevated plus maze (EPM). One quarter of each group was not tested (providing basal values of CORT and brain monoamines) and the remainder was decapitated 15, 45, or 75min after the EPM, to assess CORT reactivity. Monoamine levels were determined in the hypothalamus (HPT), frontal cortex (FC), amygdala (AMY), ventral, and dorsal hippocampus (vHPC, dHPC, respectively). MD reduced food intake, in the home-cage, and latency to eat in the NSF in both sexes; females explored less the target animal in the SIT and explored more the open arms of the EPM than males; the CORT response to the EPM was greater in maternally-deprived males and females than in their control counterparts, and this response was further elevated in maternally-deprived females injected with saline. Regarding monoamine levels, females were less affected, showing isolated effects of the stressors, while in males, MD increased 5-HT levels in the HPT and decreased this monoamine in the FC, MD associated with saline reduced dopamine levels in all brain regions, except the HPT. MD at 11days did not alter emotional behaviors in adult rats, but had an impact in neurobiological parameters associated with this class of behaviors. The impact of MD associated with saline on dopamine levels suggests that males may be vulnerable to motivation-related disorders.","2018","2018-12-21 16:23:54","2018-12-21 16:23:54","","333-346","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","corticosterone; dopamine; emotional behavior; Maternal deprivation; neonatal stress; sex differences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, we are frequently confronted with nonverbal social signals, including eye-gaze direction, from multiple individuals. Yet, the factors that allow for the prioritisation of certain gaze cues over others are poorly understood. Using a modified conflicting gaze paradigm, we tested the hypothesis that fearful gaze would be favoured amongst competing gaze cues. We further hypothesised that this effect is related to the increased sclera exposure, which is characteristic of fearful expressions. Across three experiments, we found that fearful, but not happy, gaze guides observers' attention over competing non-emotional gaze. The guidance of attention by fearful gaze appears to be linked to increased sclera exposure. However, differences in sclera exposure do not prioritise competing gazes of other types. Thus, fearful gaze guides attention among competing cues and this effect is facilitated by increased sclera exposure - but increased sclera exposure per se does not guide attention. The prioritisation of fearful gaze over non-emotional gaze likely represents an adaptive means of selectively attending to survival-relevant spatial locations.","2018","2018-12-21 16:23:55","2018-12-21 16:23:55","","1178-1188","","6","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attentional bias; fear; Gaze cueing; sclera; shared attention; social attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of perceived trainer responses to errors on trainee learning from errors in a workplace setting. In Study 1, the authors test a model that examines the associations between perceived trainer responses to errors and trainee learning from errors, which are mediated by affective-motivational adaptivity. In Study 2, the authors further hypothesize that the link between perceived trainer responses and affective-motivational adaptivity is moderated by perceived error climate. Design/methodology/approach The authors test the hypotheses using data from 213 Swiss apprentices (Study 1) and 1,012 German apprentices (Study 2) receiving dual vocational training. Findings Study 1 suggests that negative trainer reaction impedes trainee learning from errors by impairing trainees' affective-motivational adaptability. Trainer tolerance of errors and trainer support following errors were not related to trainee learning from errors. Study 2 indicates that perceived error climate is an important boundary condition that affects the relationship between trainer responses and trainee learning from errors. Originality/value This study contributes to research on learning from errors in three ways. First, it enriches the understanding regarding the role of trainers in enhancing learning from errors in organizations.

However, no study has investigated whether circadian rhythm dysfunction would affect the clinical course of BD. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that circadian rhythm dysfunction could be a predictor of relapse in euthymic BD patients. Methods: One hundred four euthymic outpatients with BD diagnosed according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), participated in this prospective follow-up study from August 2014 to April 2015. At baseline, data on demographic variables and clinical descriptive variables of bipolar disorder were ascertained via clinical interviews. The diagnoses of circadian rhythm sleepwake disorders (CRSWDs) were made based on participants' sleep logs for 4 weeks and according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3). The BD symptoms of the subjects were evaluated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores every 4 weeks throughout the 48-week study period. Relapse of BD was defined as scores higher than the cutoff points (MADRS score >= 13 and YMRS score >= 7). The primary outcome was time to relapse of mood episodes. Results: Thirty-four subjects met criteria for CRSWD at baseline, most frequently delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (n = 27). Of the total 104 subjects, 51 (49.0%) experienced relapse during the 48-week follow-up period. Multivariate Cox hazard regression analyses revealed that 2 or more previous mood episodes within the past year and comorbidity of CRSWD were significantly associated with the time to relapse of mood episodes (P < .001). Conclusions: Comorbid CRSWD, mainly delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, could be a significant predictor of relapse in BD patients.","2018-02","2018-12-21 16:23:56","2018-12-21 16:23:56","","","","1","79","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing research suggests that acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) may effectively treat major depressive disorder (MDD). We compared ACT with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression, testing the hypothesis that CBT would outperform ACT. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 82 patients suffering from MDD. Data were collected before and after treatment and at the 6-month follow-up, assessing diagnosis, symptom levels of depression, and quality of life. Results: After treatment, the rates of remission from depression were 75 and 80% for the ACT and CBT conditions, respectively. Patients in both conditions further reported significant and large reductions in depressive symptoms and improvement in quality of life from before to after treatment as well as at the follow-up. Our findings indicated no significant differences between the two intervention groups. Conclusion: Our results indicate that CBT is not more effective in treating depression than ACT. Further research is needed to investigate whether ACT and CBT work differently for different groups of patients with depression. (C) 2018 S.

To test the hypothesis that specific yoga practices are associated with reduced psychological distress, 186 adults completed questionnaires assessing life stressors, symptom severity, and experience with each of these aspects of yoga. Each yoga sub-component was found to be negatively correlated with psychological distress indices. However, differing patterns of relationship to psychological distress symptoms were found for each yoga sub-component. Experience with asana was negatively correlated with global psychological distress (r=-.21, p<.01), and symptoms of anxiety (r=-.18, p=.01) and depression (r=-.17, p=.02). These relationships remained statistically significant after accounting for variance attributable to Social Readjustment Rating Scale scores (GSI: r=-.19, p=.01; BSI Anxiety: r=-.16, p=.04; BSI Depression: r=-.14, p=.05). By contrast, the correlations between other yoga sub-components and symptom subscales became non-significant after accounting for exposure to life stressors. Moreover, stressful life events moderated the predictive relationship between amount of asana experience and depressive symptoms. Asana was not related to depressive symptoms at low levels of life stressors, but became associated at mean (t[182]=-2.73, p<.01) and high levels (t[182]=-3.56, p<.001). Findings suggest asana may possess depressive symptom reduction benefits, particularly as life stressors increase. Additional research is needed to differentiate whether asana has an effect on psychological distress, and to better understand potential psychophysiological mechanisms of action.","2018","2018-12-21 16:23:57","2018-12-21 16:23:57","","870-879","","7","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Depression; moderation; psychological distress; stress; yoga","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach The study utilized a quantitative approach. In total, 314 employees participated in the online survey. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. Findings Results show that protecting private time and working efficiently significantly relate with WLB and that WLB mediates the relationships between these two WLB crafting behaviors and SWB. Findings also suggest a significant direct relationship between behaviors that foster family relationships and SWB. Research limitations/implications The study is correlational in nature.

Furthermore, the authors suggest that the relationship between P-O fit and OSC is contingent upon the level of TL. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Field study data were used to test the hypotheses. In total, 336 employees from eight different service sector organizations in Pakistan participated in this study. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings In support of the hypotheses, the authors found that TL was positively related to both P-O fit and OSC. Also, P-O fit mediated the TL-OSC relationship. Finally, TL moderated the relationship between P-O fit and OSC. Research limitations/implications Cross-sectional data were collected through self-reports, which raises concerns of reporting bias. Practical implications Managers can benefit from the study by focusing on TL as a vehicle for not only achieving change, but also for creating an environment that facilitates better P-O fit and enhanced OSC. Social implications This study provided a rare opportunity to examine the proposed relationships in a developing country. This enhances our insight into the efficacy of theories that have been mainly developed and tested in developed countries. Originality/value Previous research hypothesized P-O fit as a mediator between leadership and performance, yet failed to receive support. The current study is unique by demonstrating that TL, as a relational leadership style, contributes to building an important resource (OSC) through the mediating effect of P-O fit.","2018","2018-12-21 16:23:58","2018-12-21 16:23:58","","913-930","","4","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Organizational social capital; Person-organization fit (P-O fit); Quantitative; Transformational leadership (TL)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that MOT affects the motor performance of aiming movements. Therefore, the participants performed pointing movements using their fingers or a computer mouse that controlled the movements of a cursor directed at the targets in the MOT task. The precision of the pointing movements was measured, and it was predicted that a higher number of targets and distractors in the MOT task would result in a lower pointing precision. The results confirmed this hypothesis, indicating that MOT might influence the performance of motor actions.

However, the effect of product design dimensions on consumer willingness-to-buy (WTB) and word-of-mouth (WOM) is virtually ignored by consumer researchers. Similarly, whether the consumption experience can differentiate the effect of the three product design dimensions on WTB and WOM is completely unknown. Using categorization theory as a lens, our study aims to explore the effect of product design dimensions on consumer WTB and WOM directly and indirectly through the moderation of the consumption experience. Methods: A convenience sample of (n-357) Chinese and 11-.277) Korean shoppers was utilized to test the hypotheses in the fashion apparel industry. Results: Our results showed that the aesthetic design was more prominent in capturing consumer WTB for both Chinese and Koreans. Similarly, the aesthetic design was more salient in enhancing WOM for Chinese, whereas the symbolic design was more promising in terms of improving WOM for Koreans. Further, our moderation results demonstrated that the consumption experience could differentiate the effects of the three product design dimensions on consumer WTB and WOM for Chinese. By contrast, the consumption experience could only interact with the aesthetic design to improve WOM for South Koreans. Conclusion: To the best of authors' knowledge, the present study is one of the initial attempts to link three product design dimensions with consumer WT11 and WOM in the fashion apparel context and explored whether consumption experience competes or complement with three product design dimensions to shape consumer WTB and WOM for Chinese and Koreans.","2018","2018-12-21 16:24:00","2018-12-21 16:24:00","","169-185","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China and South Korea; consumption experience; product design dimensions; willingness-to-buy; word-of-mouth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has not been experimentally tested to date. We tested the hypotheses that electrical potentiation in the right DLPFC would be associated with increased empathic concern and prosocial behavior. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) conditions: (a) relative right potentiation, (b) relative left potentiation, and (c) sham. Participants viewed images of African children in distressing circumstances, and completed measures of empathic concern pre-and post-tDCS manipulation. Contrary to our prediction, neither effects, nor interactions of heightened empathic concern were observed. These results conflict with previous studies using this bilateral tDCS montage. Explanations could be that stimulation used in this study had been simply too weak (1.5 mA). Alternatively, the area of the DLPFC involved in emotion regulation is closer to the cortex than the area involved in empathic concern, and more easily potentiated by tDCS. Therefore, the DLPFC potentiation in the present study may have linked empathic concern with adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Future research could examine this possibility using measures of emotion regulation and higher fidelity neurostimulation (e.g., repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [rTMS]).","2018","2018-12-21 16:24:00","2018-12-21 16:24:00","","190-201","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Empathic concern; lateralization; prefrontal cortex; prosocial behavior; transcranial direct current stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we tested the hypothesis that reminders of mortality and physical pain decrease brain activity underlying self-related thoughts. Three groups of adults underwent priming procedures during which they answered questions pertaining to mortality, physical pain, or leisure time, respectively. Before and after priming, participants performed personality trait judgments on oneself or a celebrity, identified the font of words, or passively viewed a fixation. The default-mode activity and neural activity underlying self-reflection were identified by contrasting viewing a fixation vs. font judgment and trait judgments on oneself vs. a celebrity, respectively. The analyses of the pre-priming functional MRI (fMRI) data identified the default-mode activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and parahippocampal gyrus, and the activity underlying instructed self-reflection in both the ventral and dorsal regions of the MPFC. The analyses of the post-priming fMRI data revealed that, relative to leisure time priming, reminding mortality significantly reduced the default-mode PCC activity, and reminding physical pain significantly decreased the dorsal MPFC activity during instructed self-reflection.

At present, few studies have investigated the associations between different forms of adversity and inflammation during infancy, making it difficult to specify the origins of disease vulnerability. This study examined the association between multiple forms of early adversity - socioeconomic status disadvantage, familial stress, maternal depression, and security of attachment - and individual differences in a composite measure of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and the inflammatory protein C-reactive protein that were collected via saliva when (n = 49) children were 17 months old. In addition to gauging the direct effects of adversity, we also tested the hypothesis that infants' attachment relationship with their mother might buffer infants against the immunologic effects of early adversity. Results show that familial stress, maternal depression, and security of attachment were directly associated with infant salivary inflammation and that attachment status moderated the effect of maternal depression. The findings suggest that exposure to certain forms of adversity very early in life may engender a pro-inflammatory phenotype with possible life-long implications for health.","2018","2018-12-21 16:24:01","2018-12-21 16:24:01","","1-23","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","C-reactive protein; early adversity; infancy; Inflammation; pro-inflammatory cytokines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we focus on those facets of the construct that are considered to be rather value-laden and affectively tinged. Following the widely used theoretical model of teachers' professional competencies developed by Baumert and Kunter (2013), we conceptually place these facets within the Beliefs, Values, & Goals dimension, and propose four core elements: (1) appreciation of cultural diversity; (2) ethnorelative worldview; (3) attitudes toward integration; and (4) identification with goals of intercultural education. In order to test the hypothesis that these four aspects represent one single overarching latent construct, we operationalized each with an appropriate scale and then scrutinized the instruments' internal consistency, and convergent and factorial validity. The results suggest that our four scales have good internal consistencies (Cronbach's alphas between .82 and .89), adhere to a one-factor structure (as demonstrated by Confirmatory Factor Analysis), and indicate one latent construct (RMSEA = 0.000; TLI = 1.004; CFI = 1.000; SRMR = .007).

The current study used complementary behavioral and neuroimaging approaches to test the hypothesis that intragroup conflict heightens participants' susceptibility to subsequent false memories. Healthy young adults witnessed and later answered questions about events in which the perpetrator and victim were either 1) identified as in-group members relative to each other and the eyewitness, 2) out-group members relative to the eyewitness, but not each other, or 3) out-group members relative to each other (Experiments 1a and 1b). When perpetrators and victims were in-group members (intragroup conflict), participants showed heightened false memory rates. Moreover, false memories increased upon crime realization. Neuroimaging data analysis revealed that salient (as compared to ambiguous) intragroup conflict elicited heightened activation in neural regions associated with resolving cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate cortex; ACC). Increased functional connectivity between the ACC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subsequent false memories (Experiment 2).

Two experiments were used to test the hypothesis that American mock jurors would punish a veteran (vs. a civilian) with PTSD for a violent crime less harshly because of their own collective guilt (i.e., the guilt felt for the transgressions of one's in-group) about the veteran's suffering due to war. The participants were United States citizens recruited online (n = 174) who completed a mock-juror experiment involving a violent assault committed by either a veteran or a civilian with PTSD. As predicted, jurors were more lenient toward the veteran (vs. the civilian). For male mock jurors this was explained by their collective guilt for the veteran's war-related suffering. A second study experimentally induced individual and collective guilt about veteran defendants, finding that mock jurors (n = 533) who are less likely to share a salient in-group identity with the veteran (i.e., women, people with lower national identification with the United States) can be induced to feel the requisite guilt to exhibit leniency toward a veteran. Thus, veterans suffering from PTSD may receive more lenient punishment because they elicit a sense of collective guilt in legal decision-makers.","2018","2018-12-21 16:24:04","2018-12-21 16:24:04","","32-58","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","collective guilt; jury decision-making; punishment; veteran","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that demands on executive control can be alleviated by internally representing the temporal pattern of goals and deadlines as spatial relations. In two experiments, participants completed a multitasking session by monitoring deadlines of four clocks running at different rates, along with separate tasks of executive functioning and spatial ability. In Experiment 1, individual and gender-related differences in spatial ability (mental rotation) predicted multitasking performance, beyond the contributions of both the updating and inhibition components of executive functioning, and even when spatial cues were eliminated from the layout of the monitoring task. Experiment 2 extended these findings by showing that concurrent spatial load impaired task monitoring accuracy, and that these detrimental effects were accentuated when spatial abilities were compromized due to fluctuation in female sex hormones. These findings suggest that multiple task monitoring involves working memory-related functions, but that these cognitive control demands can be offloaded by relying on spatial relation processes.","2018","2018-12-21 16:24:05","2018-12-21 16:24:05","","230-241","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive offloading; executive functioning; Multitasking; spatial ability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms accounting for these adverse outcomes have not been empirically delineated. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociation are documented sequelae of PV and are associated with a wide range of behavioral/emotional problems. This study used a cross-sectional research design and bootstrapped multiple mediation analyses with self-report measures completed by a large sample of justice-involved youth (N=809, ages 12-19years old, 27% female, 46.5% youth of color) to test the hypothesis that PTSD and dissociation symptoms mediate the relationship between PV and problems with anger, depression/anxiety, alcohol/drug use, and somatic complaints after controlling for the effects of exposure to violence and adversities related to juvenile justice involvement. As hypothesized, PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship of PV with all outcomes except alcohol/drug use problems (which had an unmediated direct association with PV). Partially supporting study hypotheses, dissociation symptoms mediated the relationship between PV and internalizing problems (i.e., depression anxiety; suicide ideation). Implications are discussed for prospective research demarcating the mechanisms linking PV and adverse outcomes in juvenile justice and other high risk populations.","2018","2018-12-21 16:24:06","2018-12-21 16:24:06","","325-346","","3, SI","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; dissociation; juvenile justice; Polyvictimization; PTSD; trauma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the framework of the fundamental attribution error, we demonstrated that those who actually played the game, as opposed to those who simply watched someone else playing it, identified with the main character. In accordance with the theoretical expectation, those who played the game and came to identify with the main character attributed the responsibility for his actions to external factors such as “living in a violent society.” By contrast, those who did not interact with the game attributed responsibility for the character's actions to his personality traits. These findings could be viewed as contrasting with psychological research suggesting that respondents should have distanced themselves from the violent protagonist rather than identifying with him, and with Iyengar's (1991) expectation that more personalized episodic framing would be associated with attributing responsibility to the protagonist.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:06","2018-12-21 16:24:06","","3-15","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","FAE; human-computer interaction; identification; interactivity; video games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cross-sectional mediator models are used to test the hypothesis. Findings The processes proposed by the JD-R model find empirical support. Job demands primarily cause exhaustion while job resources increase job satisfaction. Besides, job demands reduce job satisfaction and job resources lead to less exhaustion. An exception is found for cognitive workload which rather acts like a job resource. EO mediates these effects in a favorable way. High job resources foster EO, which in turn reduces exhaustion and enhances job satisfaction. For job demands, EO shows a negative mediation reducing the health-impairment process and increasing job satisfaction.

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a survey questionnaire from 1,302 managers working in eight Indian private sector organizations. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression analysis were used to test the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. Findings The study found evidence of the mediating role of work engagement for the relationship between motivating job characteristics and managers' turnover intentions. Conscientiousness moderated the relationship between work engagement and turnover intention. The total and indirect effects of motivating job characteristics on turnover intention were moderated by conscientiousness. Research limitations/implications The study was cross-sectional, so inferences about causality are limited. Practical implications The findings of this study reaffirm the crucial role of job characteristics in influencing work engagement and turnover intention. By examining work engagement as a mediator for the job characteristics-turnover intention relationship, this study explores the process through which job characteristics are associated with turnover intention. The findings of the moderating influence of contentiousness on the relationship of direct and indirect effects of job characteristics suggests that individual personality can influence social exchanges as well as managerial attitudes and behaviors in multiple ways.

Further, equity sensitivity, a dispositional variable reflecting one's tendency to give or take in their interpersonal interactions, was tested as a moderator of these effects. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a sample of 240 manufacturing employees in China and their respective supervisors. Multilevel analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized effects. Findings LMX was found to be positively associated with affiliative, but not change-oriented OCB. Equity sensitivity moderated these relationships, such that LMX was positively associated with both types of OCB when employees are benevolent, but not when they are entitled. Research limitations/implications Given the different pattern of relationships that were observed between LMX and affiliative vs change-oriented OCB, the results suggest that LMX may differentially influence these two types of OCB.

Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire data for this cross-sectional, quantitative study were collected from 371 front-line workers in a Chinese manufacturer.

Findings - The results show that work instrumentalism significantly reduces the positive effect of training on job satisfaction while boosting the positive effect of remuneration on job satisfaction. In contrast, there is no evidence for an interaction between instrumentalism and employee involvement. Practical implications - The results imply that the degree to which HR practices are effective in promoting job satisfaction among these Chinese workers depends both on their work-value orientations and on the implications of the particular HR practice. Managers concerned about job satisfaction in China need to consider the impact of work values and the goals of particular HR practices.

Additionally, the parents of each child filled out a questionnaire about his or her food rejection tendencies.

We discovered, first, that the more women view philosophy as masculine, the less they identify with it, and second, that the less women identify with philosophy, the less they want to major in it. Interestingly, this result does not hold for men-their viewing philosophy as masculine does not correspond to their identification with it, nor does it correlate with their likelihood of majoring in it. We also discovered that the typical student does not have a preconceived notion of philosophy as masculine; this suggests that they come to view philosophy as masculine the more they do it, which in turn supports the possibility that teaching the discipline differently may prevent students from conceiving of philosophy as masculine, thus allowing a path to reducing the gender disparity.","2018","2018-12-21 16:24:11","2018-12-21 16:24:11","","68-88","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Gender disparity; gender identity; implicit bias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent evidence suggests that action-based processing may facilitate the ability to follow instructions, which relies largely on working memory. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SZ patients may also benefit from action-based advantages in following instructions. Forty-eight clinically stable SZ patients and 48 demographic- and IQ-matched controls completed a following spoken instruction span task involving varied encoding and recall conditions. While SZ patients were impaired in the overall performance of following spoken instructions, this deficit could be attributed to working memory impairment. More importantly, SZ patients showed action-based advantages both at the encoding and retrieval stage to the same extent as healthy controls. Specifically, both healthy controls and SZ patients showed improved memory performance when they additionally performed the actions, or watched the experimenter carrying out the actions compared with simply listening to spoken instructions during the encoding stage. During the retrieval stage, memory was improved when they recalled the instructions by physical enactment compared with oral repetition. The present study provides the first empirical evidence for the impairment in the ability to follow instructions in SZ. We have shown that involving action-based processing in the encoding and retrieval stage facilitated memory of instructions, indicating that the enactment advantage in working memory also applies to SZ patients. These findings provide useful insights for clinical interventions and cognitive remediation for SZ patients.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:13","2018-12-21 16:24:13","","137-146","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","enacted-recall advantage; experimenter-performed task effect; schizophrenia; subject-performed task effect; working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Florian","Human Information Processing Shapes Language Change","PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE","","0956-7976","10.1177/0956797617728726","","Human languages exhibit both striking diversity and abstract commonalities. Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths. These results provide direct evidence for a causal link between processing preferences in individual speakers and patterns in linguistic diversity.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:14","2018-12-21 16:24:14","","72-82","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","dependency length; language evolution; language processing; language structure; language universals; learning biases; open materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that embitterment is positively correlated with rumination, and that this effect is influenced by positive beliefs about rumination. Method: A convenience sample (N = 79) of staff of a health care facility attending its occupational health service completed questionnaires assessing chronic embitterment, work-related rumination (distinguishing affective rumination and problem solving pondering), positive beliefs about rumination, and depression. Results: Embitterment scores correlated positively with affective rumination and depression. Positive beliefs about rumination correlated positively with problem-solving pondering but not with affective rumination. Regression analysis revealed that affective rumination contributed to embitterment independently of depression. Conclusions: Previous research has demonstrated that rumination impairs executive functions and problem-solving. The association of affective rumination with embitterment may contribute to the explanation for why embitterment becomes chronic and is often difficult to alleviate. However, this association also opens up possibilities of intervention, in light of research evidence of the effectiveness of rumination-focused therapies.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:14","2018-12-21 16:24:14","","7-13","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affect; depression; embitterment; rumination; workplace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study tested the hypothesis that mental disorders moderate the association between diabetes status and alcohol consumption. A total of 14,302 adult participants aged 40-79 were included from the cross-sectional 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (1,698 with diabetes). Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear regression models. MDD and BD, but not GAD, significantly moderated the association between diabetes status and alcohol quantity, such that the presence of diabetes was strongly and negatively associated with alcohol quantity if individuals had MDD or BD. There was no interaction between diabetes status and any of the mental disorders and alcohol frequency. This study suggests that among individuals with diabetes, those with comorbid MDD or BD drink less than those without MDD or BD. Further investigation of this association is needed and could help inform future alcohol-related interventions among individuals with diabetes.","2018","2018-12-21 16:24:15","2018-12-21 16:24:15","","277-284","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol; bipolar disorder; Diabetes; generalized anxiety disorder; major depressive disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guided by emotional security theory, this study tested the hypothesis that children's emotional insecurity mediates associations between interparental conflict and their social difficulties by undermining their affiliative goals in best friendships. Participants included 235 families with the first of 5 measurement occasions over a 10-year period occurring when children were in kindergarten (mean age = 6 years). Findings from the lagged latent difference score analyses indicated that intensification of multi-method assessment of interparental conflict during the early school years predicted subsequent increases in children's emotional insecurity 5 years later in adolescence. In the latter part of the cascade, rises in emotional insecurity predicted decreases in adolescent friendship affiliation, which, in turn, were specifically associated with declines in social competence. The specificity of this cascade of changing processes in predicting social problems was supported by the robustness of the findings after the inclusion of static measures of each construct as predictors, parent-child relationship insecurity as a covariate, and increases in children's internalizing symptoms as an alternative outcome.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:16","2018-12-21 16:24:16","","83-97","","1","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","child social development; child stress reactivity; interparental conflict","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined what happens when dramatic stories, of which the valence evolves over time, are used as unconditioned stimuli. In three experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the conditioning effect of stories depends on the valence of the ending, even when the beginning is of the opposite valence. Experiment 1 (N = 61) used a 2 x 3 within-participants design. Unknown consumer brands were paired with either good-ending or bad-ending stories, and the presentation of the brands was either before the beginning, before the ending, or after the ending. On both an implicit and an explicit attitude measure, we found that brands paired with good-ending stories were liked more than brands paired with bad-ending stories, and this effect was largest for brands presented after the ending. In Experiment 2 (N = 131), the explicit attitude results were replicated in a larger sample. In Experiment 3 (N = 127), the order of story segments was reversed such that the ending was told before the beginning.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that writing about conflicted personal goals and values (conflict condition) would impair self-control on an unrelated subsequent task as compared to writing about clear personal goals and values (clarity condition). Personal conflict activates the behavioral inhibition system (BIS; Hirsh, Mar, & Peterson, 2012), which may make it harder for participants to successfully execute self-control. In this large (N = 337), pre-registered study participants in the conflict condition performed worse on anagrams than participants in the clarity condition, and the effect of condition on anagram performance was mediated by a subjective uncertainty measure of BIS activation. This suggests that BIS activation leads to poor self-control. Moreover, given that conflict is inherent in the exercise of self-control, results point to BIS activation as a mechanism for why initial acts of self-control impair self-control on subsequent, unrelated tasks.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:18","2018-12-21 16:24:18","","157-160","","","74","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stimuli were continuous low-frequency noises that included two brief shifts of either type (ITD or ILD), both of which are heard as lateral position changes. TBW for judgments within a single cue dimension were narrower for ITD (mean = 444 ms) than ILD (807 ms). TBW for judgments across cue dimensions (i.e., one ITD shift and one ILD shift) were similar to within-cue ILD (778 ms). The results contradict the original hypothesis, in that cross-cue comparisons were no slower than within-cue ILD comparisons. Rather, the wide TBW values-consistent with previous estimates of multisensory TBW-suggest slow integrative processing for both types of judgments. Narrower TBW for ITD than ILD judgments suggests important cue-specific differences in the neural mechanisms or the perceptual correlates of integration across binaural-cue dimensions.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:18","2018-12-21 16:24:18","","14-20","","1","80","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Audition; Multisensory processing; Spatial localization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our understanding of the complex relationship between schizophrenia symptomatology and etiological factors can be improved by studying brain-based correlates of schizophrenia. Research showed that impairments in value processing and executive functioning, which have been associated with prefrontal brain areas [particularly the medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC)], are linked to negative symptoms. Here we tested the hypothesis that MOFC thickness is associated with negative symptom severity. Methods. This study included 1985 individuals with schizophrenia from 17 research groups around the world contributing to the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group. Cortical thickness values were obtained from T1-weighted structural brain scans using FreeSurfer. A meta-analysis across sites was conducted over effect sizes from a model predicting cortical thickness by negative symptom score (harmonized Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores). Results. Meta-analytical results showed that left, but not right, MOFC thickness was significantly associated with negative symptom severity (beta(std) =-0.075; p = 0.019) after accounting for age, gender, and site. This effect remained significant (p = 0.036) in a model including overall illness severity. Covarying for duration of illness, age of onset, antipsychotic medication or handedness weakened the association of negative symptoms with left MOFC thickness. As part of a secondary analysis including 10 other prefrontal regions further associations in the left lateral orbitofrontal gyrus and pars opercularis emerged. Conclusions. Using an unusually large cohort and a meta-analytical approach, our findings point towards a link between prefrontal thinning and negative symptom severity in schizophrenia. This finding provides further insight into the relationship between structural brain abnormalities and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:19","2018-12-21 16:24:19","","82-94","","1","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cortical thickness; ENIGMA; FreeSurfer; medial orbitofrontal cortex; MRI; negative symptoms; PANSS; SANS; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regular cannabis use appears to be a dynamic, chronic process consisting of multiple quit attempts, periods of reduction, periods of abstinence, and periods of continual use. Cannabis-related processes, including withdrawal, problematic consequences of use, and self-efficacy for quitting each contribute to the cycle of use and, in part, are maintained and reinforced by perceived barriers for cannabis cessation. Yet, no work has examined the association between perceived barriers for cannabis cessation and clinically-relevant processes related to cannabis use. To address this gap, the current study recruited a racially diverse sample (N = 145, 63.4% Black or African American) of cannabis users from the community to test the hypothesis that greater perceived barriers for quitting cannabis was related to more cannabis use problems, more cannabis withdrawal symptoms, and lower self-efficacy for quitting cannabis. Structural equation modeling suggested that greater perceived barriers for quitting cannabis was uniquely associated with cannabis use problems (beta = 0.50, 95%CI [0.39, 0.65], p < 0.001), greater withdrawal symptoms (beta = 0.39, 95%CI [0.30, 0.50], p < 0.001), and lower self-efficacy for quitting (beta = -0.17, 95%CI [- 0.21, - 0.02], p = 0.028). The results of this study indicate perceived barriers for cannabis cessation may help in better understanding an array of clinically significant cannabis use processes. Indeed, the observed pattern of findings add to current theoretical models of substance use that aim to identify unique risk processes that may maintain substance use and provide valuable information that can be used to inform treatment for cannabis users.","2018-01","2018-12-21 16:24:20","2018-12-21 16:24:20","","45-51","","","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that men's sexual jealousy mechanisms functionally calibrate their psychological output according to genetic variation at the androgen receptor locus. Mated men (N = 103) provided buccal cell samples for genotype fragment analysis and completed inventories assessing their sexually jealous cognitions and emotions. Results indicated that men with longer sequences of CAG codon repeats at the androgen receptor locus were more likely to perceive ambiguous social and environmental cues as indicative of their mates' infidelity, and experienced greater emotional upset in response to these cues. These results contribute to a growing body of research linking polymorphism at the AR locus to individual differences in psychology, and, to our knowledge, provide the first evidence pointing toward the heritability of sexual jealousy. Our discussion centers on whether the heritability of psychological differences implies direct genetic influences on the neurobiological substrate, or reflects functionally calibrated output from sex-typical and species-typical mechanisms. We conclude by describing how future research can more clearly differentiate between these alternative genetic models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To test the hypothesis, 119 alcohol-dependent subjects and 97 age-and gender-matched healthy control subjects underwent structural MRI. Whole-brain grey matter volume maps were computed from structural MRI scans using voxel-based morphometry and parcelled into a comprehensive set of anatomical brain regions. Regional grey matter volume averages served as the basis for cross-regional similarity analyses and a brain age model. We found a striking correspondence between regional patterns of alcohol-and age-related grey matter loss across 110 brain regions. The brain age model revealed that the brain age of age-matched AD subjects was increased by up to 11.7 years. Interestingly, while no brain aging was detected in the youngest AD subjects (20-30 years), we found that alcohol-related brain aging systematically increased in the following age decades controlling for lifetime alcohol consumption and general health status.

Swedish comprises a well-known exception, allegedly allowing extraction from relative clauses (RCE), raising the possibility that island constraints may be subject to “deep variation” between languages. One alternative is that such exceptions are only illusory and represent “surface variation” attributable to independently motivated syntactic properties. Yet, to date, no surface account has proven tenable for Swedish RCEs. The present study uses eyetracking while reading to test whether the apparent acceptability of Swedish RCEs has any processing correlates at the point of filler integration compared to uncontroversial strong island violations. Experiment 1 tests RCE against licit that-clause extraction (TCE), illicit extraction from a non-restrictive relative clause (NRCE), and an intransitive control. For this, RCE was found to pattern similarly to TCE at the point of integration in early measures, but between TCE and NRCE in total durations. Experiment 2 uses RCE and extraction from a subject NP island (SRCE) to test the hypothesis that only non-islands will show effects of implausible filler-verb dependencies. RCE showed sensitivity to the plausibility manipulation across measures at the first potential point of filler integration, whereas such effects were limited to latemeasures for SRCE. In addition, structural facilitation was seen across measures for RCE relative to SRCE. We propose that our results are compatible with RCEs being licit weak island extractions in Swedish, and that the overall picture speaks in favor of a surface rather than a deep variation approach to the lack of island effects in Swedish RCEs.","2017-12-07","2018-12-21 16:24:22","2018-12-21 16:24:22","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","eyetracking; filler-gap; integration; island constraints; plausibility; relative clause; sentence processing; Swedish","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the hypothesis that such bias occurs in left-to-right reading laypeople and gymnastic judges (n = 48 each) when asked to select the more beautiful image from a picture pair showing gymnastic or non-gymnastic actions (Experiment 1) and to evaluate videos of gymnasts' balance beam performances (Experiment 2). Overall, laypeople demonstrated a stronger left-to-right bias than judges. Unlike judges, laypeople rated images with left-to-right trajectory as more beautiful than content-wise identical images with right-to-left trajectory (Experiment 1). Also, laypeople tended to award slightly more points to videos showing left-to-right as opposed to right-to-left oriented actions (Experiment 2); however, in contrast to initial predictions the effect was weak and statistically unreliable. Collectively, judges, when considered as a group, seem less prone to directional bias than laypeople, thus tentatively suggesting that directionality may be an issue for unskilled but not for skilled judging. Possible mechanisms underlying the skill effect in Experiment 1 and the absence of clear bias in Experiment 2 are discussed alongside propositions for a broadening of perspectives in future research.","2017-12-05","2018-12-21 16:24:22","2018-12-21 16:24:22","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bias; expertise; fluency; gymnastics; laterality; preference; scanning habit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Guided by the goodness-of-fit framework, this study tested the hypothesis that kindergarten children's (N = 338) daily cortisol would be affected by the “match” or “mismatch” between children's temperament and qualities of the classroom relational context. The robustness of these associations was also explored among a separate sample of children in third grade (N = 165). Results among kindergarten children showed negative affectivity and overcontrolled temperament were positively related to cortisol expression within classrooms characterized by lower levels of teacher motivational support, but there was no relation between temperament and cortisol when motivational support was higher. Among third-grade children, negative affectivity was marginally positively related to cortisol at lower levels of teacher-child closeness and unrelated at higher levels of teacher-child closeness. Findings suggest children's cortisol expression depends on the extent to which specific temperamental characteristics “fit” within the relational and contextual qualities of the classroom environment, particularly as children navigate the new roles and relationships that emerge during the transition to formal schooling. Developmentally informed neurobiological research in classrooms may contribute to tailored programmatic efforts to support children's school adjustment.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:23","2018-12-21 16:24:23","","1763-1775","","5, SI","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sample of 8,834 Caucasian individuals from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) were used to (a) examine the developmental pathways of ASB from age 13 to 32 using growth mixture modeling, (b) compute weighted multigenic risk scores (Add Health MRS) for ASB from six well-characterized polymorphisms in dopamine and serotonin genes, and (c) test the interaction between the Add Health MRS and a measures of support (incorporating indicators of both positive and negative support from parents and schools). Four pathways of adolescent to adult ASB emerged from the growth mixture models: low, adolescence-peaked, high decline, and persistent. Add Health MRS predicted the persistent ASB pathway, but not other ASB pathways. Males with high Add Health MRS, but not low MRS, had significantly greater odds of being in the adolescence-peaked pathway relative to the low pathway at low levels of school connectedness. Nonfamilial environmental influences during adolescence may have a cumulative impact on the development of ASB, particularly among males with greater underlying genetic risks.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:23","2018-12-21 16:24:23","","1947-1967","","5, SI","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We control for individual preferences using the degree of selfishness expressed in the allocation decisions, and we account for variations in the difficulty of making decisions based on subjects' prosocial inclination. Our results support the heuristic hypothesis: Generosity seems to be an effect of “fast and frugal” behavioral rules that simplify decisions, especially when it conflicts with an underlying tendency to behave in a self-interested manner.

In contrast, social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by a negative view of the self, yet what causes and maintains this negative self-view is not well understood. Here the authors use a novel experimental paradigm and computational model to test the hypothesis that biased social learning regarding self-evaluation and self-feelings represents a core feature that distinguishes adults with SAD from healthy controls. Twenty-one adults with SAD and 35 healthy controls (HCs) performed a speech in front of 3 judges. They subsequently evaluated themselves and received performance feedback from the judges and then rated how they felt about themselves and the judges. Affective updating (i.e., change in feelings about the self over time, in response to feedback from the judges) was modeled using an adapted Rescorla-Wagner learning model. HCs demonstrated a positivity bias in affective updating, which was absent in SAD. Further, self-performance ratings revealed group differences in learning from positive feedback-a difference that endured at an average of 1 year follow up. These findings demonstrate the presence and long-term endurance of positively biased social learning about the self among healthy adults, a bias that is absent or reversed among socially anxious adults.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:24","2018-12-21 16:24:24","","1144-1155","","8","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","feedback monitoring; learning; positivity bias; social anxiety disorder; social emotions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From this perspective, awareness of inevitable death can trigger withdrawal from the goal to continue living, which precipitates a general collapse in the goal-approach system and causes depression. Withdrawal from life functions to resolve motivational conflict regarding life and death, however, and thereby reduces feelings of anxiety. The current research extends this theorizing by testing the hypothesis that reactivating the goal to continue living among people who are life-withdrawn reduces feelings of depression but increases anxiety. Based on the evidence, we propose a model of depression and anxiety stemming from death-awareness that sheds light on depression-anxiety comorbidity, and discuss implications of the model for understanding depressive symptomatology.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:25","2018-12-21 16:24:25","","860-882","","10","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anxiety; depression; desire for life; goal-regulation; terror management theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that customer aggression increased both destructive and constructive deviance. Further, psychological ownership moderated the relationship between customer aggression and constructive deviance, but not between customer aggression and destructive deviance.

It was hypothesized that more autonomous forms of motivation would predict the intensity of physical activity (PA), which in turn, would predict depressive symptoms. In order to evaluate self-determined motivation, the Self-Determination Index (SDI) was used. Because the reasons that can lead a person to engage in walking, moderate PA, or vigorous PA may be different, 3 independent self-determination indexes were measured (SDIWalking, SDIModerate, and SDIVigorous). It was also measured the metabolic equivalent of task values (METs) for walking, moderate, and vigorous PA, as well as the depressive symptoms. The sample consisted of 357 college students whose ages ranged from 18 to 29 years. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. The indices of fit showed that the revised model fits the data reasonably well: S-B-(11)(2)=14.83, p=.190; (2)/df=1.35; *comparative fit index=.99; *root mean square error of approximation=.03, 90% CI [.000, .068]; standardised root mean square residual=.03. It was found that vigorous PA is the only intensity that predicts depressive symptoms. In other words, SDIV-predicted vigorous PA (measured as METSV), which subsequently predicted less depressive symptoms (SDIVMET(S)VDepressive symptoms). Further research should investigate the effects of vigorous PA on depressive symptoms.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:27","2018-12-21 16:24:27","","600-607","","5","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","depression; physical activity; self-determination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicated that need frustration related to higher stress, which in turn, related to higher evening fatigue. Need frustration also related to poorer subjective sleep quality and shorter sleep duration, as indicated by both subjective and objective shorter total sleep time and subjective (but not objective) longer sleep latency. These associations were accounted for by stress and negative sleep cognitions.

AimsTo test the hypothesis that change in prisoners-criminal thinking and institutional misconduct-will both follow completion of a brief cognitive behavioural intervention. MethodsA one-group pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental design was used to assess change on the General Criminal Thinking (GCT) scale of the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles among 219 male prisoners completing a 10-week cognitive behavioural intervention, referred to as Lifestyle Issues'. Institutional misconduct was measured for 1year prior to completion of the course and 2years subsequently. Using variable-oriented analysis, post-test GCT scores were compared with change in prison conduct, controlling for the pre-test thinking scores. Calculations were repeated by using person-oriented analysis. ResultsPrisoners who displayed a drop in GCT scores between pre-test and post-test levels were significantly more likely to show a reduction in prison misconduct, whereas prison misconduct was likely to escalate among those who displayed a rise in criminal thinking scores from pre-test to post-test. ConclusionsThese findings must still be regarded as preliminary, but taken together with other work and with cognitive behavioural theory, they suggest that development of more prosocial thinking and abilities may have an early beneficial effect on institutional behaviour. Their measurement may offer a practical way in which men could be assessed for readiness to return to the community.

Drawing on descriptive and prescriptive elements of women's social roles, we empirically examined the gendered nature of money stereotypes. Specifically in the current work, we introduced and investigated the femininity-money incongruity hypothesis, which suggests that when the concepts of femininity and money are both cognitively activated, money will become a liability for women, causing decrements in cognitive functioning. We first probed the role of gender identity and benevolent sexism beliefs in women's endorsement of money-gender stereotypes. In two subsequent experiments, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneously activating money and femininity would lead to decrements in cognitive functioning. Converging results across studies suggest that money is incompatible with the stereotypic female gender identity, and this incongruity has detrimental cognitive costs for women as they navigate gender roles. Implications of societal challenges imposed on women by gender stereotypes regarding money matters at work and in relationship contexts and proposed interventions are discussed.

Thus, we examined whether other more modifiable sources of individual differences such as self-efficacy and self-perceptions of aging would mediate the association between personality traits and depressive symptoms in older adults. MethodData were obtained from 3,507 older adult participants who took part in the 2012 Health and Retirement Study. The Big Five personality traits, self-efficacy, aging perceptions, and depressive symptoms were assessed. Mediation analyses tested the hypothesis that self-efficacy and aging perceptions would mediate the relationship between personality traits and depressive symptoms. ResultsAll five personality traits were significant predictors of depressive symptoms. Neuroticism was positively associated with depressive symptoms and had the greatest effect compared with the other personality traits. There was a significant indirect effect of neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness on depressive symptoms (including both mediators). The mediating effect of aging perceptions on the relationship between neuroticism and depressive symptoms was the strongest compared with self-efficacy, accounting for approximately 80% of the total indirect effect.

MethodsA total of 180 participants were recruited from Sina Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, who were diagnosed with depression based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision and Beck Depression Inventory. Participants (n=180) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to Groups A, B, and C. The last two were provided with an instruction to consume Caspian white fish marinated in the presence or absence of EOPF (434g each week or four meals per week). Group A served as the control with the common diet. The outcome measures were performed using the Beck Depression Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire. ResultsThere were no statistically significant differences in depressive symptom scores between groups with frequent fish consumption as compared with the control (p>0.05). Yet adjustment for covariates showed that there was a significant reduction in depression among them (p<0.05).

However, less is known whether patients with first-episode non-affective psychosis (FENP) present subthreshold indices of dyslipidaemia. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis whether subclinical lipid profile alterations occur already in antipsychotic-naive FENP patients. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis we adhered to the PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Academic Search Complete, ERIC and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition from database inception to Dec 12, 2016, for case-control studies measuring the levels of total cholesterol, low-and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) and triglycerides in patientswith FENP and controls. W calculated effect size (ES) estimates as Hedges'g and pooled data using random-or fixed-effects models depending on heterogeneity. Our study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42016051732). Results: Out of 2466 records identified, 19 studies representing 1803 participants were finally included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled analysis revealed that FENP patients had significantly lower levels of total cholesterol [ES = -0.16 (95% CI: -0.27, -0.06), p = 0.003], LDL [ES = -0.13 (95% CI: -0.24, -0.01), p= 0.034] and HDL [ES=-0.27 (95% CI:-0.49,-0.05), p= 0.018] as well as significantly higher levels of triglycerides [ES= 0.22 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.32), p b 0.001] compared to controls. After removing single studies in sensitivity analysis, ES estimate for LDL levels was insignificant. Conclusions: Antipsychotic-naive patients with FENP present subclinical dyslipidaemia.

This variability may be explained, at least in part, by individual differences in exposure to printed language, because practice at reading promotes the development of stronger reading skills. In the present eyetracking experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the efficiency of word recognition during reading improves with increases in print exposure, by determining whether the magnitude of the repetition-priming effect is modulated by individual differences in scores on the author recognition test (ART). Lexical repetition of target words was manipulated across pairs of unrelated sentences that were presented on consecutive trials. The magnitude of the repetition effect was modulated by print exposure in early measures of processing, such that the magnitude of the effect was inversely related to scores on the ART. The results showed that low levels of print exposure, and thus lower-quality lexical representations, are associated with high levels of difficulty recognizing words, and thus with the greatest room to benefit from repetition. Furthermore, the interaction between scores on the ART and repetition suggests that print exposure is not simply an index of general reading speed, but rather that higher levels of print exposure are associated with an enhanced ability to access lexical knowledge and recognize words during reading.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:32","2018-12-21 16:24:32","","1935-1942","","6","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Eye movements; Reading; Repetition priming; Visual word recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main findings were that voluntarily single young adults reported a lower level of romantic loneliness compared to involuntarily single young adults. The two groups differed neither in regard to positive mental health nor in regard to mental health problems. In addition, gender differences were observed solely in the domain of romantic loneliness, with women reporting greater romantic loneliness than men.

This mediation effect was interpreted as the cognitive-affect model of academic achievement. The current research confirms the generalizability of the findings and tests the hypothesis that there are cultural differences in the mediation effects with the inclusion of non-Chinese students and their parents as a comparison group. The responses from 103 Chinese speaking (CS) and 163 non-Chinese speaking (NCS) primary students and parents from two schools in Hong Kong were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Student measures included self-concept, cognitive ability and academic achievement in mathematics, English and Chinese. Parent measures included home involvement, beliefs of their child's cognitive ability and expectations of academic success. Initial model showed that parental expectations mediate the link between cognitive ability and academic achievement for both CS and NCS groups, with parental involvement predicting English achievement for only the NCS group. After the inclusion of academic self-concept, the model showed that CS parental expectations also mediate the link between self-concept and academic achievement. However, the model showed that the parental expectations of NCS play a lesser role in mediating the link between academic self-concept and their children's academic achievement. Despite the differences, the results provide evidence for the generalizability of the cognitive-affect model.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:33","2018-12-21 16:24:33","","3388-3400","","12","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Academic self-concept; Achievement; Cognitive ability; Mediation; Parental expectations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the strict limitations of its capacity, the mechanisms that prevent WM from being cluttered and choked by no longer relevant information are of paramount importance. The present study tested the hypothesis put forward by the SOB-CS model of an active and attention-demanding mechanism that would remove no-longer relevant items from WM. Such a mechanism has been advocated to account for the well-known fact that, in complex span tasks, processing distractors at a slower pace results in better recall of memory items. According to the SOB-CS model, slow pace would free more time for removing distractors, thus alleviating the interference they create on target items. In direct contradiction with this hypothesis, a first experiment demonstrated that distractors are not less, but more accessible at the end of complex span task trials in which they have been processed at a slow rather than a fast pace. Using the repetition priming effect occurring in a lexical decision task inserted as processing component within a complex span task, a second experiment established that distractors processed at a slower pace do not elicit weaker, but stronger repetition priming effects, indicating that they have not been removed. Along with previous findings, the present study not only shows that there is no trace of distractor removal in the long term, in the short term, nor immediately after processing, but demonstrates that memory traces of distractors are stronger in situations assumed to involve a more complete removal by the SOB-CS model. These empirical evidence suggests that distractors are not actively removed from working memory after having been processed.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:34","2018-12-21 16:24:34","","129-138","","","169","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Complex span; Distractor removal; Forgetting; Inhibition; Temporal decay; Working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However there is only preliminary evidence relating decentering to improved motivation, and no studies have controlled for changes in affect which can obscure the measurement of motivation (Harmon-Jones, Harmon-Jones, & Price, 2013). In the current investigation, two experiments tested the hypothesis that decentering increases approach motivation, a buoyant state characterized by goal pursuit, independently of changes in affect. In Study 1 (N = 148), decentering was induced using a self-distancing manipulation (i.e. fly-on-the-wall; Kross & Ayduk, 2011), and in Study 2 (N = 143) decentering was induced using brief instructions on applying non judgmental awareness of thoughts. Following previous research showing that decentering is most effective against negative emotional reactivity for distressed people (Kross & Ayduk, 2009), our hypothesis focused on high trait distress participants. Trait distress was operationalized as the average of standardized distress-related scales (e.g. rumination, depression, uncertainty aversion), and state affect was operationalized using the Felt Uncertainty Scale and the PANAS. Analyses revealed that decentering increased self-reported approach motivation for high trait distress individuals, and that this effect was not mediated by changes in state affect.

The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that personality traits related to affect regulation would be associated with greater frequency of other tobacco product (OTP) use in a sample of young adult non-daily smokers. Methods: Participants (n = 518, 51% male) aged 18-24 were non-daily cigarette smokers recruited from the community for a longitudinal study of tobacco use. Personality characteristics (impulsivity, anhedonia, and negative affectivity) were measured at baseline, and participants reported recent tobacco use at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months later. Assessments were conducted online or via mobile phone. Results: Across the 4 assessments, 33-52% of participants reported recent OTP use, with frequency of use decreasing over time. Longitudinal negative binomial regression models indicated that greater sensation seeking and lack of premeditation were associated with more frequent OTP use (ps < 0.05). These effects were consistent over time. Conclusions: Findings suggest that young adult non-daily cigarette smokers with greater propensity for immediately rewarding behaviors may use OTPs more frequently. Young, non-daily cigarette smokers with high levels of sensation seeking and/or lack of premeditation may be at increased risk for harms related to OTP use and may benefit from prevention and cessation strategies that specifically address affect.","2017-12","2018-12-21 16:24:36","2018-12-21 16:24:36","","79-84","","","75","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Affect regulation; Personality; Tobacco; Young adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary process mentation is not only supposed to be dominant in the unconscious but also, for example, in dreams. The present study tests the hypothesis that the mental activity during REM-sleep has more characteristics of the primary process, while during non-REM-sleep more secondary process operations take place. Because the solving of a rebus requires the ability to non-contexually condensate the literal reading of single stimuli into a new one, rebus solving is a primary process operation by excellence. In a replication of the dream-rebus study of Shevrin and Fisher (1967), a rebus, which consisted of an image of a comb (German: “Kamm”) and an image of a raft (German: “Flo beta”), resulting in the German rebus word “kampflos” (Engl.: without a struggle), was flashed subliminally (at 1 ms) to 20 participants before going to sleep. Upon consecutive awakenings participants were asked for a dream report, free associations and an image description. Based on objective association norms, there were significantly more conceptual associations referring to Kamm and Flo beta indexing secondary process mentation when subjects were awakened from non-REM sleep as compared to REM-awakenings. There were not significantly more rebus associations referring to kampflos indexing primary process mentation when awakened from REM-sleep as compared to non-REM awakenings. However, when the associations were scored on the basis of each subject's individual norms, there was a rebus effect with more idiosyncratic rebus associations in awakenings after REM than after non-REM-sleep. Our results support the general idea that REM-sleep is characterized by primary process thinking, while non-REM-sleep mentation follows the rules of the secondary process.","2017-11-20","2018-12-21 16:24:36","2018-12-21 16:24:36","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","dream; free association; Freud; primary process; rebus; REM; subliminal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Failure in this ability could be related to dysfunctions in the neural circuits underlying executive functions. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that factors such as years of schooling and literacy may positively influence goal-directed behavior and inhibitory control. However, we do not yet know whether these factors also have a significant impact on the inhibitory control of oculomotor responses. Using pro- and antisaccadic tasks to assess the behavioral responses of healthy adults, we tested the contribution of years of schooling and reading proficiency to their oculomotor control, while simultaneously analyzing the effects of other individual characteristics related to demographic, cognitive and motor profiles. This approach allowed us to test the hypothesis that schooling factors are closely related to oculomotor performance. Indeed, a regression analysis revealed important contributions of reading speed and intellectual functioning to the choices on both pro- and antisaccadic tasks, while years of schooling, age and block sequence emerged as important predictors of the kinematic properties of eye movements on antisaccadic tasks. Thus, our findings show that years of schooling and reading speed had a strong predictive influence on the oculomotor measures, although age and order of presentation also influenced saccadic performance, as previously reported. Unexpectedly, we found that an indirect measure of intellectual ability also proved to be a good predictor of the control of saccadic movements. The methods and findings of this study will be useful for identifying and breaking down the cognitive and educational components involved in assessing voluntary and automatic responses.","2017-11-20","2018-12-21 16:24:37","2018-12-21 16:24:37","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adults; antisaccades; education; neuropsychology; prosaccades; reading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, the structure of the data theoretically calls for a hierarchical structure of the model, and hence, this is introduced into the BPM framework and is compared to a non-hierarchical structure of the same model. Finally, a discussion is undertaken on the advantages of a Bayesian approach to calculating parameter inference. Two models are built by utilizing vague and informed prior distributions respectively, and the results are compared. This study shows the importance of building appropriate model structures for analysis and demonstrates the advantages and challenges of utilizing a Bayesian approach.

Using an agent-based model of cultural evolution, we investigated the idea that tempering the novelty-generating effects of creativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation is beneficial for society. In Experiment One we systematically introduced individual differences in creativity, and observed a trade-off between the ratio of creators to imitators and how creative the creators were. Excess creativity was detrimental because creators invested in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating proven ones. Experiment Two tested the hypothesis that society as a whole benefits if individuals adjust how creative they are in accordance with their creative success. When effective creators created more, and ineffective creators created less (social regulation), the agents segregated into creators and imitators, and the mean fitness of outputs was temporarily higher. We hypothesized that the temporary nature of the effect was attributable to a ceiling on output fitness. In Experiment Three we made the space of possible outputs open-ended by giving agents the capacity to chain simple outputs into arbitrarily complex ones such that fitter outputs were always possible. With the capacity for chained outputs, the effect of social regulation could indeed be maintained indefinitely. The results are discussed in light of empirical data.","2017-11","2018-12-21 16:24:39","2018-12-21 16:24:39","","403-419","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agent-based model; creativity; imitation; individual differences; social regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying early phenotypic differences between vulnerable individuals and healthy control subjects could help identify those at higher risk. Binge drinking, defined as reaching a blood alcohol level of 80 mg%, carries a risk of negative legal and health outcomes and may be an early marker of vulnerability. Using a carefully controlled experimental paradigm, the authors tested the hypothesis that risk factors for alcohol use disorder, including family history of alcoholism, male sex, impulsivity, and low level of response to alcohol, would predict rate of binging during an individual alcohol consumption session. Method: This cross-sectional study included 159 young social drinkers who completed a laboratory session in which they self-administered alcohol intravenously. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether risk factors for alcohol use disorder were associated with the rate of achieving a binge-level exposure. Results: A greater percentage of relatives with alcoholism(hazard ratio: 1.04, 95% CI=1.02-1.07), male sex (hazard ratio: 1.74, 95% CI=1.03-2.93), and higher impulsivity (hazard ratio: 1.17, 95% CI=1.00 to 1.37) were associated with a higher rate of binging throughout the session. Participants with all three risk factors had the highest rate of binging throughout the session compared with the lowest risk group (hazard ratio: 5.27,95% CI=1.81-15.30). Conclusions: Binge drinking may be an early indicator of vulnerability to alcohol use disorder and should be carefully assessed as part of a thorough clinical evaluation.","2017-11-01","2018-12-21 16:24:41","2018-12-21 16:24:41","","1094-1101","","11","174","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While often it is not clear what specific information should be prioritized in encoding from the many characteristics of an object, different types of object representations facilitate different types of generalizations. We tested the hypotheses that 1-year-old infants distinctively represent familiar objects as exemplars of their kind, and that ostensive communication plays a role in determining kind membership for ambiguous objects. In the training phase of our experiment, infants were exposed to movies displaying an agent sorting objects from two categories (cups and plates) into two locations (left or right). Afterwards, different groups of infants saw either an ostensive or a non-ostensive demonstration performed by the agent, revealing that a new object that looked like a plate can be transformed into a cup. A third group of infants experienced no demonstration regarding the new object. During test, infants were presented with the ambiguous object in the plate format, and we measured generalization by coding anticipatory looks to the plate or the cup side. While infants looked equally often towards the two sides when the demonstration was non-ostensive, and more often to the plate side when there was no demonstration, they performed more anticipatory eye movements to the cup side when the demonstration was ostensive. Thus, ostensive demonstration likely highlighted the hidden dispositional properties of the target object as kind-relevant, guiding infants' categorization of the foldable cup as a cup, despite it looking like a plate.

However, little is known about the possibly different mechanisms underlying the pathways from NE to these two different suicide phenomena. Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is related to both negative emotions and suicidality. Thus, the present study aimed to test the differential roles of NSSI in the pathways from NE (specified by depression, anxiety, and stress) to SI and from NE to SA. This study hypothesized that NSSI served as a mediator in the relationship from NE to SA, but not in the relationship from NE to SI. We assessed the study variables among 3600 Chinese students (56.6% females, mean age = 14.63 years) for 3times at 6-month intervals. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Results partly supported the hypothesized longitudinal mediation model, such that NSSI fully mediated the relation from NE to SA in females, while partially mediated the relation from NE to SI in both females and males. Findings of this study may help to better understand the distinct mechanisms underlying the relationships from NE to SI and SA. Moreover, our finding regarding gender differences suggests the different emphases in suicide prevention and intervention programs across genders.","2017-11","2018-12-21 16:24:42","2018-12-21 16:24:42","","1609-1619","","8, SI","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Different paths; Negative emotions; Nonsuicidal self-injury; Suicide attempt; Suicide ideation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This cross-sectional research tested the hypothesis that co-parenting conflicts in divorced couples are associated with perceived social network disapproval and that this relation is mediated by parents' tendency to forgive each other. In Study 1, a convenience sample of 136 divorced parents recruited via online forums, we showed that perceived social network disapproval was indeed positively related to co-parenting conflicts and that parents' tendency to forgive the other parent-albeit partly-explained this relationship. Strength of our research is that in Study 2, 110 parents referred to children's mental health care because the wellbeing of the children was severely compromised by the severity of the conflicts between parents, we replicated these results. In both studies perceived social network disapproval and co-parenting conflicts were positively related and this link was mediated by forgiveness: perceived social network disapproval was negatively related to forgiveness, which in turn was negatively related to more parental conflicts.","2017-11","2018-12-21 16:24:43","2018-12-21 16:24:43","","3055-3066","","11","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Co-parenting conflicts; Forgiveness; High conflict divorce; Parental adjustment; Social network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In two studies with different visual subsecond interval timing paradigms, participants judged their attentional state on a trial-by-trial basis. Mind wandering states were characterized by underestimation of temporal intervals and a decline in temporal discrimination. Further analyses suggested that temporal contraction during mind wandering, but not the decline in temporal discrimination, could be attributed in part to attentional lapses. By contrast, we did not find any robust evidence that metacognition pertaining to interval timing was altered during mind wandering states. These results highlight the role of transient fluctuations in attentional states in intraindividual variability in time perception and have implications for the perceptual consequences, behavioral markers, and costs and benefits, of mind wandering.","2017-11","2018-12-21 16:24:44","2018-12-21 16:24:44","","1864-1871","","11","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attention; interval timing; metacognition; mind wandering; predictive coding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Univariate analysis, multiple regression analysis, and structured equation, modeling (SEM) were used to analyze the data. The relationship between neglect and sexual abuse and the severity of depressive symptoms was mostly mediated by the personality traits of high harm avoidance, low self-directedness, and low cooperativeness. This finding was supported by the results of stepwise multiple regression analysis and the acceptable fit indices of SEM. Thus, our results suggest that personality traits mediate the relationship between childhood abuse and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia.

A cross-sectional design was employed. Athletes (N = 381; mean age 16.54) from a variety of individual (n = 132) and team sports (n = 249) completed a multisection questionnaire tapping the targeted variables. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships through a direct, a fully mediated, and a partially mediated model. The analyses provided best support for the partially mediated model which showed that (a) the relationships between the need for competence and athletes' positive and negative self-talk were partially mediated by autonomous motivation; (b) the relationships between the need for relatedness and athletes' positive and negative self-talk were fully mediated by autonomous motivation; (c) the relationship between the need for autonomy and positive self-talk was partially mediated by autonomous motivation, whereas the relationship between the need for autonomy and negative self-talk was fully mediated by autonomous and controlled motivation. Overall, our self-determination theory-derived hypotheses were largely supported. These findings stress the importance of basic need satisfaction and motivational regulations, as factors that influence athletes' automatic self talk and suggest that sport environments which support athletes' basic psychological needs are likely to foster more autonomous motivation toward sport and maximize athletes' positive self-talk, while minimizing negative self-talk.","2017-11","2018-12-21 16:24:45","2018-12-21 16:24:45","","340-354","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","basic psychological needs; behavioral regulations; mediation; sport; thoughts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also analyzed the value of Body Mass Index (BMI) and atypical symptoms of depression at baseline in predicting treatment outcome. Methods: Seventy-eight adult participants were enrolled. The first treatment was controlled crossover, with randomized order, and included one hour of active bright light treatment and one hour of control dim-red light, with one-hour washout.

Limitations: Absence of a control intervention for the six-weeks of treatment (only the first session in the laboratory was controlled). Exclusion of patients with comorbid substance abuse, suicidality and bipolar I disorder, and patients on antidepressant medications, reducing the generalizability of the study.

Here we tested the hypothesis that electrical stimulation in either IC/BST or in the inferior thalamic peduncle (ITP) effectively reduces depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD). In a double-blind crossover design, the effects of electrical stimulation at both targets were compared in TRD patients. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) was the primary outcome measure. During the first crossover, patients received IC/BST stimulation versus no stimulation in random order (2 x 1 weeks). During the second crossover (3 x 2 months), patients received IC/BST versus ITP versus no stimulation. Patients and evaluators were blinded for stimulation conditions. All patients (n = 7) were followed up for at least 3 years (3-8 years) after implantation. Six patients completed the first crossover and five patients completed the second. During the first crossover, mean (s.d.) HAM-D scores were 21.5 (2.7) for no stimulation and 11.5 (8.8) for IC/BST stimulation. During the second crossover, HAM-D scores were 15.4 (7.5) for no stimulation, 7.6 (3.8) for IC/BST stimulation and 11.2 (7.5) for ITP stimulation. The final sample size was too small to statistically analyze this second crossover. At last follow-up, only one patient preferred ITP over IC/BST stimulation. Two patients, with a history of suicide attempts before implantation, committed suicide during the follow-up phases of this study. Our data indicate that, in the long term, both ITP and IC/BST stimulation may alleviate depressive symptoms in patients suffering from TRD.","2017-10-31","2018-12-21 16:24:47","2018-12-21 16:24:47","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, following a decade of transition shaped by intense controversy, embodied cognition emerged and suggested sources of control other than those implied by metaphysical information processing. With a thematic focus on embodiment science and an eye toward systematic consensus in systemic cohesion, the present study explores the roles of biofunctional and conceptual control processes in the wholetheme spiral of biofunctional understanding (see Iran-Nejad and Irannejad, 2017b, Figure 1). According to this spiral, each of the two kinds of understanding has its own unique set of knower control processes. For conceptual understanding (CU), knowers have deliberate attention-allocation control over their first-person “knowthat” and “knowhow” content combined as mutually coherent corequisites. For biofunctional understanding (BU), knowers have attention-allocation control only over their knowthat content but knowhow control content is ordinarily conspicuously absent. To test the hypothesis of differences in the manner of control between CU and BU, participants in two experiments read identical-format statements for internal consistency, as response time was recorded. The results of Experiment 1 supported the hypothesis of differences in the manner of control between the two types of control processes; and Experiment 2 confirmed the results of Experiment 1. These findings are discussed in terms of the predicted differences between BU and CU control processes, their roles in regulating the physically unobservable flow of systemic cohesion in the wholetheme spiral, and a proposal for systematic consensus in systemic cohesion to serve as the second guiding principle in biofunctional embodiment science next to physical science's first guiding principle of systematic observation.","2017-10-24","2018-12-21 16:24:47","2018-12-21 16:24:47","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","biofunctional understanding; declarative fact-seeking; embodiment science; procedural knowhow; spiral of biofunctional understanding; systematic consensus; systematic observation; unobservable systemic cohesion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been suggested that disturbances in memory functioning might explain the association between PD and PTSD, but this has not yet been empirically tested. Objective: We aimed to test the hypotheses that greater PD would be associated with more posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and that some of this association would be mediated by disorganized and non-verbal memories about the traumatic event. Method: The sample included 197 Palestinian children (10-12-years) living in the Gaza Strip, participating in the aftermath of the 2008/9 war. Self-report questionnaires were used to measure PD (Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire) three months post-war, as well as trauma-related memory (Trauma Memory Quality Questionnaire) and PTSD symptoms (Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale) six months later. Exposure to war trauma was assessed by a checklist. Structural equation modelling was used to examine direct and indirect paths from PD to posttraumatic PTSS, controlling for number of traumatic war events. Results: Structural equation modelling results showed that greater self-reported PD predicted higher levels of PTSS nine months post-war, and that a significant part, but not all, of this relationship was mediated via the quality of trauma-related memories. Conclusions: This study provided empirical evidence that, among war-affected children, greater PD during traumatic events is linked with higher levels of PTSD symptoms several months later, even when accounting for their personal exposure to war trauma. Further, the study supported the idea that the detrimental effects of dissociation during a traumatic event may be due to dysfunctional memories characterized by disorganization and lack of access to verbal and coherence. Further tests of these hypotheses with larger samples and more points of measurement are called for.","2017-10-10","2018-12-21 16:24:48","2018-12-21 16:24:48","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","children; peritraumatic dissociation; posttraumatic stress disorder; trauma-related memory; War trauma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, we propose that daily self-efficacy forms a contingency condition in that self-efficacy facilitates the translation of vitality into proactive behavior. We conducted a 7-day diary study based on a sample of 66 employees who completed surveys 3 times daily. We used multilevel regression analyses to test the hypotheses while controlling for the 1-day lagged measures of vitality and proactivity. The results provide evidence for a model of moderated mediation. Sleep quality but not quantity predicted an increase in daily vitality. Self-efficacy moderated the relationship between vitality and daily proactivity such that this relationship was stronger when self-efficacy was reported to be high rather than low. The conditional effect mediated by vitality was significant for sleep quality but not for sleep quantity and occurred at the within-person level of analysis. These results suggest that organizations aiming to boost daily proactivity in employees can benefit from increasing employees' self-efficacy and supporting them in developing strategies to ensure sufficient vitality. One such strategy is improving sleep quality.

This is partly due to an absence of measures for assessing police violence exposure from the standpoint of civilians. As such, the demographic distribution and mental health correlates of police victimisation are poorly understood. The aims of this study were to present community-based prevalence estimates of positive policing and police victimisation based on assessment with two novel measures, and to test the hypotheses that (1) exposure to police victimisation would vary across demographic groups and (2) would be associated with depression and psychological distress. Methods The Survey of Police-Public Encounters study surveyed adults residing in four US cities to examine the prevalence, demographic distribution and psychological correlates of police victimisation. Participants (N = 1615) completed measures of psychological distress (K-6 scale), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) and two newly constructed measures of civilian-reported police-public encounters. Both measures were developed to assess police victimisation based on the WHO domains of violence, which include physical violence (with and without a weapon, assessed separately), sexual violence (inappropriate sexual contact, including public strip searches), psychological violence (e.g., threatening, intimidating, stopping without cause, or using discriminatory slurs) and neglect (police not responding when called or responding too late). The Police Practices Inventory assesses lifetime history of exposure to positive policing and police victimisation, and the Expectations of Police Practices Scale assesses the perceived likelihood of future incidents of police victimisation. Linear regression models were used to test for associations between police-public encounters and psychological distress and depression. Results Psychological violence (18.6%) and police neglect (18.8%) were commonly reported in this sample and a substantial minority of respondents also reported more severe forms of violence, specifically physical (6.1%), sexual (2.8%) and physical with a weapon (3.3%). Police victimisation was more frequently reported by racial/ethnic minorities, males, transgender respondents and younger adults. Nearly all forms of victimisation (but not positive policing) were associated with psychological distress and depression in adjusted linear regression models. Conclusions Victimisation by police appears to be widespread, inequitably distributed across demographic groups and psychologically impactful. These findings suggest that public health efforts to both reduce the prevalence of police violence and to alleviate its psychological impact may be needed, particularly in disadvantaged urban communities.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:24:50","2018-12-21 16:24:50","","466-477","","5","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Community mental health; depression; social factors; violence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our study, participants viewed suspenseful film excerpts while brain activation was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results indicated that suspense produced a pattern of activation consistent with the attention-narrowing hypothesis. For example, we observed decreased activation in the anterior calcarine sulcus, which processes the visual periphery, and increased activity in nodes of the ventral attention network and decreased activity in nodes of the default mode network. Memory recall was more accurate for high suspense than low suspense moments, but did not differ by soundtrack congruency. These findings provide neural evidence that perceptual, attentional, and memory processes respond to suspense on a moment-by-moment basis.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:24:51","2018-12-21 16:24:51","","73-81","","","129","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention; Emotion; Music; Narrative transportation; Suspense","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) and decreases in heart rate variability (HRV) would be larger when threatening stimuli are presented outside of awareness, or subliminally, compared with neutral stimuli. Additionally, it was expected that trait worry and resting HRV, as common risk factors for CV disease, would moderate the effect. We presented a subliminal semantic priming paradigm to college students that were randomly assigned to the threat (n=56) or neutral condition (n=60) and assessed changes from baseline of MAP, TPR, and HRV. Level of trait worry was assessed with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. The findings indicate that CV activity changed according to the hypothesized pattern: A higher MAP and TPR and a lower HRV in the threat condition compared with the neutral condition were found with practically meaningful effect sizes. However, these findings were only statistically significant for TPR. Furthermore, changes in CV activity were not moderated by trait worry or resting HRV. This is the first study to explicitly address the role of subliminally presented threat words on health-relevant outcome measures and suggests that unconscious stress can influence peripheral vascular resistance.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:24:52","2018-12-21 16:24:52","","1498-1511","","10","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","awareness; cardiovascular activity; heart rate variability; stress; subliminal threat; worry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second experiment used a more challenging OSPAN task and stereotype primed women also had lower math accuracy than controls.

Evidence that these programmes achieve is mainly from longer-term prisoners rather than short-term jail inmates. AimThe aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that facilitating access to community resources while still in jail would reduce re-arrest rates among former jail inmates in the USA. MethodsCommunity resources offered to the jail inmates participating in this study included Medicaid, food stamps and cash assistance. Participants who opted to sign up for these social services were matched with non-applicants based on date of release (n=101). Each participant's criminal history was coded prior to release from the jail and at three months, six months and one year after release. ResultsContrary to our original hypotheses, recidivism was not significantly reduced in the applicant group. People released after facilitated access to community assistance had an increase in drug offence severity at six months after release. Recidivism also differed by age and race. ConclusionThe substance offences in the applicant group suggested that cash benefits provided the released offender with the means to sustain their substance misuse. Treatment for substance misuse should be incorporated with other resources in order to reduce recidivism effectively.

A structural equation model was tested where depression is hypothesized as affected by resilience, internalized stigma, gender and negative symptoms, with the latter two variables used as exogenous covariates and the former two as mediators. The analysis reveals that low resilience, high negative symptoms, female gender were directly associated with depression severity, and internalized stigma acted only as a mediator between avolition and resilience, with similar magnitude.

Four hundred and fifty-seven participants completed measures of negative trust, thwarted belongingness, and depression. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed that both negative trust and thwarted belongingness significantly positively predicted depression, and thwarted belongingness was positively predicted by negative trust. The results from the mediation analysis suggest that thwarted belongingness might be an underlying mechanism linking negative trust and depression.

Although adherence to CRC screening has the potential to reduce CRC mortality by approximately half, men's current rates of adherence fall below national screening objectives. In qualitative studies, men have reported foregoing screenings involving the rectum (e.g., colonoscopy) due to concern about breaching masculinity norms. However, the extent to which masculinity beliefs predict men's CRC screening adherence has yet to be examined. The current study tested the hypothesis that greater endorsement of masculinity beliefs (i.e., self-reliance, risk-taking, heterosexual self-presentation, and primacy of work) would be associated with a lower likelihood of adherence to CRC screening with any test and with colonoscopy specifically. Participants were 327 men ages 51-75 years at average risk for CRC who were accessing primary care services at a midwestern Veterans Affairs medical center. Contrary to hypotheses, masculinity beliefs did not predict CRC screening outcomes in hierarchical regression analyses that controlled for demographic predictors of screening. Although results are largely inconsistent with masculinity theory and prior qualitative findings, further research is needed to determine the degree to which findings generalize to other populations and settings.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:24:56","2018-12-21 16:24:56","","390-399","","4","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","colorectal cancer screening; masculinity; men's health; preventive health behavior; veterans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social support may act as a “buffer” against poor mental health following disability acquisition. We tested the hypothesis that women and men with low social support experienced larger declines in mental health on acquisition of a disability compared to women and men with high social support. Methods We assessed whether social support, measured both prior and subsequent to disability acquisition, modified the association between disability acquisition and mental health using 14 annual waves of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. Participants reported at least two consecutive waves of disability preceded by at least two consecutive waves without disability (2200 participants, 15,724 observations). Fixed-effects linear regression models were used to estimate average differences in mental health between waves with and without disability, for women and men separately. We tested for effect measure modification of the association by social support, including a three-way interaction between disability and social support prior and subsequent to disability acquisition. Results Though the effects of disability acquisition on mental health were much larger for women, for both women and men there was a consistent pattern of association with social support. There was evidence that social support modified the association between disability acquisition and mental health, with the largest effects for those experiencing a change from high to low social support subsequent to disability and for people with consistently low social support. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of developing new policy and practice strategies to improve the mental health of people with disabilities, including interventions to promote social support at the time of disability acquisition.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:24:57","2018-12-21 16:24:57","","1247-1255","","10","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Disability; Longitudinal; Mental health; Social epidemiology; Social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 310 HIV-infected persons (176 men and 134 women) aged 20-60 years residing in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. The bromocresol green method was used to measure serum albumin levels and the Beck Depression Inventory method was used to measure depressive symptoms, with a cut off score of 20 or higher indicating likely depression. The relationship between serum albumin levels and depressive symptoms was assessed using both multiple linear regression analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for sociodemographic, cardiovascular, life-style, and HIV-related clinical and treatment confounding factors.

Multiple mediation modeling was used to test the hypothesized mechanisms of expressive helping on distress and bothersome physical symptoms. Relative to the control condition, expressive helping produced significant reductions in psychological distress and marginal reductions in physical symptom bother in the analyzed subset of participants from the parent study. Results indicated that positive emotion word use significantly mediated effects of expressive helping on reduced distress, but only for participants who used average (compared to above or below average) rates of negative emotion words. Cognitive processing and change in perspective did not significantly mediate benefits of expressive helping.

Grounded in self-determination theory, this study sought to analyze putative antecedents, mediators, and work-related well- and ill-being consequences of two types of motivational strategies reported by exercise professionals. Participants were 366 exercise professionals (193 males; experience = 7.7 +/- 5.8 years). Questionnaires assessing psychological need satisfaction frustration, self-determined work motivation, motivational strategies (need-supportive vs. controlling), emotional exhaustion, and personal accomplishment were completed online. Path analysis was used to test the hypothesized model. Model with good fit [chi (2) (5) = 9.174, p > .05; CFI = .984; TLI = .936; RMSEA = .048; SRMR = .022] showed need satisfaction as positively associated with supportive strategies and personal accomplishment (beta between .267 and .399) and negatively with emotional exhaustion (beta = -.145). Need frustration was negatively associated with work motivation and personal accomplishment (beta = -.315; -.176), and positively with controlling strategies and emotional exhaustion (beta = .195; .226). Furthermore, supportive strategies and work motivation were positively associated with personal accomplishment (beta = .134; .184), whereas controlling strategies were positively associated with emotional exhaustion (beta = .178). Findings have theoretical implications, providing evidence of need satisfaction and frustration as being differently associated with work-related motivation, type of strategies used, and work-related emotional outcomes.

Yet research into disclosure of CHA has been atheoretical and neglected the role of health beliefs. Using a consumer commitment model of CHA use as a guiding conceptual framework, the current study tests the hypotheses that perceived positive CHA outcomes (utilitarian values) and positive CHA beliefs (symbolic values) are associated with disclosure of CHA to conventional care providers in a nationally representative US sample. From a sample of 33,594 with CHA use information from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a subsample of 7348 who used CHA within the past 12 months was analyzed. The 2012 NHIS is a cross-sectional survey of the non-institutionalized US adult population, which includes the most recent nationally representative CHA use data. The 63.2% who disclosed CHA use were older, were less educated, and had visited a health care provider in the past year. Weighted logistic regression analyses controlling for demographic variables revealed that those who disclosed were more likely to report experiencing positive psychological (improved coping and well-being) and physical outcomes (better sleep, improved health) from CHA and hold positive CHA-related beliefs. CHA users who perceive physical and psychological benefits from CHA use and who hold positive attitudes towards CHA are more likely to disclose their CHA use. Findings support the relevance of a consumer commitment perspective for understanding CHA disclosure and suggest CHA disclosure as an important proactive health behavior that warrants further attention.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:00","2018-12-21 16:25:00","","764-774","","5","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Complementary health approaches; Consumer behavior; Disclosure; Health behaviors; Health beliefs; Patient-reported outcomes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lower socioeconomic status (SES) children tend to start school with limited language skills compared to advantaged peers. We test the hypothesis that this is due in part to differences in caregiver contingent talk during infancy (how often the caregiver talks about what is in the focus of the infant's attention). Methods: In a randomised controlled trial with high and low SES families, 142 11-month olds and their caregivers were randomly allocated to either a contingent talk intervention or a dental health control. Families in the language intervention watched a video about contingent talk and were asked to practise it for 15 min a day for a month. Caregiver communication was assessed at baseline and after 1 month. Infant communication was assessed at baseline, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months. Results: At baseline, social gradients were observed in caregiver contingent talk to their 11-month olds (but not in infant communication). At posttest, when infants were 12 months old, caregivers across the SES spectrum who had been allocated to the language intervention group engaged in significantly more contingent talk. Lower SES caregivers in this intervention group also reported that their children produced significantly more words at 15 and 18 months. Effects of the intervention did not persist at 24 months. Instead expressive vocabulary at this age was best predicted by baseline infant communication, baseline contingent talk and SES. Conclusions: A social gradient in children's communication emerges during the second year of life. A low-intensity intervention demonstrated that it is possible to increase caregiver contingent talk and that this is effective in promoting vocabulary growth for lower SES infants in the short term. However, these effects are not long-lasting, suggesting that follow-up interventions may be necessary to yield benefits lasting to school entry.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:01","2018-12-21 16:25:01","","1122-1131","","10, SI","58","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Infancy; intervention; language; parenting; socioeconomic status; vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied emotional verbal memory in two groups at risk for AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and late-onset depression (LOD), to test the hypothesis that aMCI and LOD would be characterized by a negative bias in emotional memory, whereas cognitively normal (CN) adults would show the “positivity effect” associated with healthy aging. Methods: Participants completed a novel test of emotional verbal memory, the Emotional Verbal Learning Test (EVeLT), consisting of a 15-item list of words with positive, negative, or neutral valence. Recall as a function of group and valence was analyzed using mixed analysis of variance. Spearman's rho was used to examine associations between EVeLT, mood, and executive function. MCI and CN participants had no current or past history of mood or anxiety disorders. aMCI participants met neuropsychological criteria for single-domain aMCI (sd-aMCI). LOD developed their first episode of depression at >= 60 years of age. Results: CN adults recalled more positive words, whereas sd-aMCI and LOD adults recalled more negative, relative to neutral, words on the EVeLT. Positive emotional memory and negative attitudes regarding self were inversely correlated in CN adults. Conclusion: sd-aMCI and LOD groups show negative emotional memory biases, consistent with our hypothesis that emotion dysregulation is a signature of AD risk.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:02","2018-12-21 16:25:02","","1160-1170","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","emotion; geriatric depression; memory; Mild cognitive impairment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assaultive violence events are associated with increased risk for adverse psychiatric outcomes, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression, and generalized anxiety. Prior research has indicated that economic, legal, and social stressors that could follow assaultive events may explain the increased risk for adverse psychiatric outcomes, yet longitudinal studies have not adequately examined this pathway. In the current study, we aimed to address this limitation. Methods. Participants (N= 1360) were part of a longitudinal population-based study of adults living in Detroit. At three waves, participants indicated their exposure to assaultive violence and economic, legal, and social stressors, and completed inventories of PTS, depression, and generalized anxiety. Longitudinal mediation models were used to test the hypothesized pathway from assaultive violence to each psychiatric outcome. Results. The hypothesized models evidenced good fit with the data and, in each, the paths from Wave 1 (W1) assaultive violence to W2 stressors, and from W2 stressors to W3 symptoms were significant (range of Standardized Estimates: 0.09-0.15, all p < 0.01). Additionally, the indirect paths from W1 assaultive violence to W3 symptoms were significant (range of Standardized Estimates: 0.01-0.02, all p < 0.05). Conclusions. The findings illustrate that the economic, legal, and social stressors that could follow assaultive violence increase risk for a range of psychiatric symptoms. Although future research is needed, the results suggest that investment in interventions that prevent and mitigate assaultive violence survivors' exposure to such stressors may be an effective way to prevent mental illness in the aftermath of violent assaults.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:02","2018-12-21 16:25:02","","2556-2566","","14","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Assaultive violence; depression; generalized anxiety; post-traumatic stress; stressful life events","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that child cortisol reactivity at age 3 moderates associations between early parenting and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms from age 3 to age 6. One hundred and sixty children were assessed at age 3, and 135 children were reassessed at age 6. At age 3, we exposed children to stress-inducing laboratory tasks, during which we obtained four salivary cortisol samples, and parental hostility was assessed using an observational parent-child interaction task. At ages 3 and 6, child psychiatric symptoms were assessed using a clinical interview with parents. The results indicated that the combination of high child cortisol reactivity and high observed parental hostility at age 3 was associated with greater concurrent externalizing symptoms at age 3 and predicted increases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms from age 3 to age 6. Findings highlight that increased stress reactivity, within the context of hostile parenting, plays a role in the emergence of psychopathology from preschool to school entry.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:03","2018-12-21 16:25:03","","1319-1331","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were 135 children and young adolescents assessed at 6-month intervals over 1 year. Upon enrollment girls were age 8, 10, or 12 years (N = 69, M = 10.06 years) and boys were age 9, 11, or 13 years (N = 66, M = 10.94 years). Assessments included Tanner staging by a nurse, cortisol reactivity (Trier Social Stress Test for Children), diurnal testosterone, and interviews and questionnaires. Growth models showed that cortisol reactivity and diurnal testosterone basal levels (intercept) and rate of change (slopes) were not related, suggesting different mechanisms of growth. Longitudinal regression analyses assessed cortisol reactivity and diurnal testosterone longitudinally. The interactions of cortisol reactivity and diurnal testosterone showed that when diurnal testosterone was low, boys with low cortisol reactivity were reported to have more behavior problems (i.e., oppositional defiant disorder symptoms and attention problems) than when testosterone was high. In addition, when diurnal testosterone was high, boys with high or moderate cortisol reactivity were significantly higher on total antisocial behavior, attention behavior problems, and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms than when testosterone was low or moderate. The results were similar but less frequent for girls. These findings advance the science of young adolescence by showing the interaction between preexisting sensitivity to stressors and the normative testosterone changes of puberty and antisocial behavior.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:03","2018-12-21 16:25:03","","1353-1369","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two studies tested the hypothesis that self-regulatory depletion (i.e., ego depletion) moderates the relationship between trait Agreeableness and negative emotional responding. MethodEgo depletion was manipulated using a writing task. Emotional responding was measured with startle eye-blink responses (Study 1, N=71) and self-reported valence, arousal, and empathic concern (Study 2, N=256) during emotional picture viewing. Trait Agreeableness was measured using a questionnaire. ResultsIn Study 1, Agreeableness predicted especially large startle responses during aversive images and especially small startles during appetitive images. After exercising self-control, the relationship between startle magnitudes and Agreeableness decreased. In Study 2, Agreeableness predicted more empathic concern for aversive images, which in turn predicted heightened self-reported negative emotions. After exercising self-control, the relationship between Agreeableness and empathic concern decreased. ConclusionsAgreeable individuals exhibit heightened negative emotional responding. Ego depletion reduced the link between Agreeableness and negative emotional responding in Study 1 and moderated the indirect effect of Agreeableness on negative emotional responding via empathic concern in Study 2. Empathic concern appears to be a resource-intensive process underlying heightened responding to aversive stimuli among agreeable persons.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:04","2018-12-21 16:25:04","","643-657","","5","85","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Agreeableness; ego depletion; empathy; individual differences; self-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experts, in particular, face a social dilemma: from the group's perspective they should share their knowledge, whereas individually they are better off not sharing, because acquiring knowledge is costly and they would give up a competitive advantage. Two experiments (N-1=96, N-2=192) tested the hypothesis, derived from indirect reciprocity theory, that experts contribute more if their status is being recognised. Expert status was manipulated under different performance feedback conditions and the impact on people's contributions in two different knowledge sharing tasks was analysed. In both studies, experts contributed more when feedback was individualised and public, ensuring both individual status rewards and public recognition. In contrast, novices contributed more when performance feedback was collective, regardless of whether it was public or private feedback. Novices did not have to fear negative performance evaluations under group feedback and could gain in social status as members of a successful group. Social value orientation moderated expert contributions in Study 2, with proself-oriented experts being particularly susceptible to reputation gains. The studies contribute to the neglected aspect of motivation in knowledge sharing dilemmas where collective and individual interests are not necessarily aligned.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:04","2018-12-21 16:25:04","","674-709","","4","66","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, few studies have considered that employees' objective pay standing is dynamic; that is, it changes over time. In this study, we analyze the relationship between changes in employees' objective internal and external pay standing and their job performance. We test the hypotheses using data for players in the National Basketball Association over a period of 12 seasons (n = 4830). Decreases in employees' objective internal and external pay standing are negatively related to their task performance. Furthermore, decreases in employees' objective internal pay standing, but not in their external pay standing, are negatively related to their contextual performance. Analyzing the relationship between changes in employees' objective internal and external pay standing and their job performance adds to our understanding of the individual-level consequences of pay dispersion. This is one of the first studies to analyze the relationship between employees' objective internal and external pay standing and their job performance. Moreover, this is one of the first studies that considers that employees' objective internal and external pay standing changes, for example, because the external and internal labor markets change.

Furthermore, taking a person-centered perspective, we tested the hypothesis that dually committed employees score higher on the chosen outcomes than employees with unilateral commitments (to the team and the organization). Results from a survey study (n = 1362) confirmed our hypotheses for citizenship behavior.

A research model drawing on UTAUT was developed with perceived effort expectancy, performance expectancy, mobile social influence, and privacy protection as the key determinants. Data from a US sample of 656 and a Chinese sample of 866 were analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS) procedures to test this model, including the hypothesized antecedent role of some espoused cultural values.

Contrary to our expectation, the empirical data did not show strong support for the moderating effect of the espoused cultural values. Our data show espoused cultural values more of an antecedent or predictor of mobile shopping continuance.

The strength of the association between level of alcohol use and consequences may change across the initial years of college, as students develop tolerance or learn to avoid negative effects of drinking. Time varying effect models (TVEM) allow for statistical examination of the changing strength of associations between two variables as they unfold across time. Goals of the present study were to test the hypothesis that the association between weekly quantity of alcohol use and the odds of an alcohol consequence that week would decrease in strength from the first week of freshman year to the end of sophomore year, and to examine gender differences in the association between use and consequences over time. Participants (N = 812 college student drinkers, 60% female) completed 36 assessments of alcohol use and consequences across two years (every other week). TVEM models revealed that the proportion of those for whom alcohol use led to a consequence declined across time. Aside from the first few weeks of college, the association between alcohol use and odds of a consequence was consistently stronger for women than men. Among men, the odds of a consequence declined relatively steadily over time. Among women, the strength of this association was more dynamic. This study provides initial insight into the complex relationship between drinking and consequences. Future research focusing on understanding factors that explain the decreasing association between use and consequences with time can contribute to college student alcohol education and interventions.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:07","2018-12-21 16:25:07","","57-62","","","73","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alcohol; Alcohol consequences; College students; Time varying effect model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that friendship associations partly predict gateway escalations in the use of drugs from adolescence to adulthood. Method: This longitudinal study analyzed 3 waves of data from a community sample of 711 male and female participants without a history of illicit drug use reporting drug use at age 17, 22, and 27. Substance use assessments including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, onset and abuse/dependence tendency of illicit drugs other than cannabis (i.e., cocaine, methamphetamine, and opiates), and friends' reported use of illicit drugs. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. Results: Participants' cannabis use level at age 17 was positively associated with perceived friends' drug use at age 22, which in turn predicted participants' onset of illicit drug use between ages 22 and 27. Moreover, progression of tobacco use throughout age 17 to 22 was associated with an increased onset of illicit drug use between ages 22 and 27. Apart for an effect of cannabis use at age 22 on abuse and dependence tendency to various drugs at age 28, results were similar. Conclusions: During this period of development, the availability and selection of drug -using friends contributes to the progression to potentially more rewarding and damaging illicit drugs. These findings suggest the need to attend to the peer ecology in prevention and support the common practice of using abstaining peers in treatment for drug dependence.","2017-10","2018-12-21 16:25:07","2018-12-21 16:25:07","","144-150","","","73","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cannabis; Gateway model; Illicit drugs; Peer clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This process is described as an emotion-based memory-trace of previous meetings and could be disrupted in schizophrenia. Consequently, familiarity disorders could be involved in the impaired social interactions observed in patients with schizophrenia. Previous studies have primarily focused on famous people recognition. Our aim was to identify underlying features, such as emotional disturbances, that may contribute to familiarity disorders in schizophrenia. We hypothesize that patients with familiarity disorders will exhibit a lack of familiarity that could be detected by a flattened skin conductance response (SCR). Method: The SCR was recorded to test the hypothesis that emotional reactivity disturbances occur in patients with schizophrenia during the categorization of specific familiar, famous and unknown faces as male or female. Forty-eight subjects were divided into the following 3 matched groups with 16 subjects per group: control subjects, schizophrenic people with familiarity disorder, and schizophrenic people without familiarity disorders. Results: Emotional arousal is reflected by the skin conductance measures. The control subjects and the patients without familiarity disorders experienced a differential emotional response to the specific familiar faces compared with that to the unknown faces. Nevertheless, overall, the schizophrenic patients without familiarity disorders showed a weaker response across conditions compared with the control subjects. In contrast, the patients with familiarity disorders did not show any significant differences in their emotional response to the faces, regardless of the condition. Conclusion: Only patients with familiarity disorders fail to exhibit a difference in emotional response between familiar and non-familiar faces. These patients likely emotionally process familiar faces similarly to unknown faces. Hence, the lower feelings of familiarity in schizophrenia may be a premise enabling the emergence of familiarity disorders.","2017-09-28","2018-12-21 16:25:08","2018-12-21 16:25:08","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Capgras; familiarity disorders; Fregoli; schizophrenia; skin conductance response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is frequently seen in neurodevelopmental disorders that manifest early in development, especially attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, irritability can also be conceptualized as a mood problem because of its links with anxiety/ depressive disorders; notably DSM-5 currently classifies severe, childhood-onset irritability as a mood disorder. Investigations into the genetic nature of irritability are lacking although twin studies suggest it shares genetic risks with both ADHD and depression. We investigated the genetic underpinnings of irritability using a molecular genetic approach, testing the hypothesis that early irritability (in childhood/ adolescence) is associated with genetic risk for ADHD, as indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRS). As a secondary aim we investigated associations between irritability and PRS for major depressive disorder (MDD). Three UK samples were utilized: two longitudinal population-based cohorts with irritability data from childhood (7 years) to adolescence (15-16 years), and one ADHD patient sample (6-18 years). Irritability was defined using parent reports. PRS were derived from large genome-wide association meta-analyses. We observed associations between ADHD PRS and early irritability in our clinical ADHD sample and one of the population samples. This suggests that early irritability traits share genetic risk with ADHD in the general population and are a marker of higher genetic loading in individuals with an ADHD diagnosis. Associations with MDD PRS were not observed. This suggests that early-onset irritability could be conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental difficulty, behaving more like disorders such as ADHD than mood disorders.","2017-09-26","2018-12-21 16:25:09","2018-12-21 16:25:09","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been hypothesized that the brain works to minimize the resources allocated toward higher cognitive functioning. Thus, for the intelligent brain, it may be that not simply more is better, but rather, more efficient is better. Energy metabolism supports both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission processes. Indeed, in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, the primary energetic costs are associated with neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that minimizing resources through the excitation-inhibition balance encompassing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate may be beneficial to general cognitive functioning using 7 T `H-MRS in 23 healthy individuals (male/female = 16/7, 27.7 5.3 years). We find that a higher working memory index is significantly correlated with a lower GABA to glutamate ratio in the frontal cortex and with a lower glutamate level in the occipital cortex. Thus, it seems that working memory performance is associated with the excitation-inhibition balance in the brain.","2017-09-15","2018-12-21 16:25:09","2018-12-21 16:25:09","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","7 T; gamma-aminobutyric acid; glutamate; H-MRS; intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, we tested the hypothesis that sensitivity to mild stressors in particular is predictive of the developmental course of psychopathology. Methods: We analyzed experience sampling and questionnaire data collected at baseline and one-year follow-up of 445 adolescent and young adult twins and non-twin siblings (age range: 15-34). Linear multilevel regression was used for the replication analyses. To test if affective sensitivity to mild stressors in particular was associated with follow-up symptoms, we used a categorical approach adding variables on affective sensitivity to mild, moderate and severe daily stressors to the model. Results: Linear analyses showed that emotional stress reactivity was not associated with onset (beta = .02; P =.56) or persistence (beta = -01; P = .78) of symptoms. There was a significant effect of baseline symptom score (beta = .53; P < .001) and average negative affect (NA: beta = .19; P < .001) on follow-up symptoms. Using the categorical approach, we found that affective sensitivity to mild (beta =.25; P < .001), but not moderate (beta = -03; P = .65) or severe (beta = -.06; P = .42), stressors was associated with symptom persistence one year later. Discussion: We were unable to replicate previous findings relating stress sensitivity linearly to symptom onset or persistence in a younger sample. Whereas sensitivity to more severe stressors may reflect adaptive coping, high sensitivity to the mildest of daily stressors may indicate an increased risk for psychopathology.

In our study, we investigated neuroticism in CSO and tested the hypothesis that CSO with high neuroticism show more serious abuse behavior and are more likely to exhibit sexual dysfunction and cognitive distortions, as compared to CSO with low neuroticism. A sample of 40 CSO (both child sexual abusers and child sexual material users) was split into two subsamples based on their neuroticism scores, obtained by the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R) questionnaire. Subsequently, we compared their scores in the Multiphasic Sex Inventory (MSI) questionnaire and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Our results show that CSO exhibited higher levels of neuroticism than controls, but were still in the normal range. In CSO, neuroticism was associated with sexual dysfunction and cognitive distortions, rather than with more severe abuse behavior. Moreover, neuroticism in this group was linked to a broad range of psychological problems and psychopathological symptoms, such as somatization or anxiety. Our findings suggest that neuroticism even below the level of personality disorder is associated with a broader range of psychological problems in CSO, which should be addressed in therapy.

One likely mechanism by which this occurs is the application of attention to potentially relevant objects. Here we test the hypothesis that category membership influences the allocation of attention, allowing attention to be applied not only to object features, but to entire categories. Participants briefly learned to categorize a set of novel cartoon animals after which EEG was recorded while participants distinguished between a target and non-target category. A second identical EEG session was conducted after two sessions of categorization practice. The category structure and task design allowed parametric manipulation of number of target features while holding feature frequency and category membership constant. We found no evidence that category membership influenced attentional selection: a postero-lateral negative component, labeled the selection negativity/N250, increased over time and was sensitive to number of target features, not target categories. In contrast, the right hemisphere N170 was not sensitive to target features. The P300 appeared sensitive to category in the first session, but showed a graded sensitivity to number of target features in the second session, possibly suggesting a transition from rule-based to similarity based categorization.","2017-09","2018-12-21 16:25:11","2018-12-21 16:25:11","","18-30","","","104","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention; Category Learning; ERP; N250; P300; Selection Negativity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although amygdala activation is most often associated with fearful or angry stimuli, there is considerable evidence that the response of the amygdala to neutral faces is both robust and reliable. This characteristic of amygdala function is of particular interest in the context of assessing populations with executive function deficits, such as traumatic brain injuries, which can be evaluated using fMRI attention modulation tasks that evaluate prefrontal control over representations, notably faces. The current study tested the hypothesis that the amygdala may serve as a marker of selective attention to neutral faces. Using fMRI, we gathered data within a chronic traumatic brain injury population. Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal change within the left and right amygdalae and fusiform face areas was measured while participants viewed neutral faces and scenes, under conditions requiring participants to (1) categorize pictures of faces and scenes, (2) selectively attend to either faces or scenes, or (3) attend to both faces and scenes. Findings revealed that the amygdala is an effective marker for selective attention to neutral faces and, furthermore, it was more face-specific than the fusiform face area.","2017-09","2018-12-21 16:25:12","2018-12-21 16:25:12","","214-222","","","104","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Amygdala; Face perception; fMRI; Selective attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the current study tested the process model of SDT in a sample of outpatients with SMI. Participants were 294 adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder or a personality disorder and their clinicians (n=57). Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships between autonomy support, perceived competence, types of motivation, treatment engagement, psychosocial functioning and quality of life at two time points and across the two diagnostic groups. The expected relations among the SDT variables were found, but additional direct paths between perceived competence and clinical outcomes were needed to obtain good model fit. The obtained process model was found to be stable across time and different diagnostic patient groups, and was able to explain 18% to 36% of variance in treatment engagement, psychosocial functioning and quality of life. It is concluded that SDT can be a useful basis for interventions in the mental health care for outpatients with SMI. Additional experimental research is needed to confirm the causality of the relations between the SDT constructs and their ability to influence treatment outcomes.","2017-09","2018-12-21 16:25:13","2018-12-21 16:25:13","","","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","motivation; personality disorders; psychotic disorders; self-determination; theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that allostatic load (AL), derived from a battery of peripheral biomarkers indexing the cumulative effects of stress, is associated with abnormalities in brain white matter microstructure, especially the fornix, and that higher AL may help explain the white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia. Methods: Using 13 predefined biomarkers, we tested AL in 44 schizophrenic patients and 33 healthy controls. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the fornix and other white matter tracts. Results: AL scores were significantly elevated in patients compared with controls (F(3,77) = 7.87, p = .006). AL was significantly and inversely correlated with FA of fornix in both controls (r = -.58, p = .001) and patients (r = -.36, p = .023). Several nominally significant (p < .05 but did not survive Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison) correlations were also observed between AL and FA of other white matter tracts in schizophrenic patients. However, the fornix was the only tract exhibiting a correlation with AL in both groups.

Methods: Participants were 1954 men and women from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development with complete data on cognitive ability at age of 15 years and measures of grip strength and chair rise speed at ages of 53 and 60 to 64 years. Using multinomial logistic regression, associations of childhood cognitive ability with categories of change in grip strength and chair rise speed (i.e., decline, stable high, stable low, reference) were investigated. Adjustments were made for potential confounders from early life and adult mediators including health behaviors, educational level, and cognitive ability at age of 53 years. Results: Higher childhood cognitive scores were associated with reduced risks of decline in grip strength and chair rise speed, for example, the sex-adjusted relative-risk ratio of decline (versus reference) in grip strength per 1SD increase in childhood cognitive score was 0.82 (95% confidence interval = 0.73-0.92). Higher childhood cognitive scores were also associated with reduced risk of stable low and increased likelihood of stable high chair rise speed. Conclusions: These findings suggest that childhood cognitive ability may be related to decline in physical capability in late midlife. A number of life course pathways are implicated, including those linking childhood and adult cognitive ability. Future research aiming to identify new opportunities to prevent or minimize age-related declines in physical capability may benefit from considering the potential role of neurodevelopmental as well as neurodegenerative pathways.","2017-09","2018-12-21 16:25:14","2018-12-21 16:25:14","","785-791","","7","79","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","age-related decline; cognition; life course; neurodevelopment; physical capability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study tested the hypothesis that both dysfunctional beliefs and EA uniquely predict BID even after accounting for general distress. A nonclinical female sample (N = 100) completed measures of general distress, dysfunctional beliefs about appearance, EA, and BID in addition to providing in vivo anxiety ratings after looking at their most dissatisfactory facial feature in a vanity mirror.

Analogously, interference from similar representations during retrieval is a major cause of age-related memory failures. To demonstrate a suppression mechanism that underlies such speech and memory difficulties, we tested the hypothesis that interference between targets and competitors is resolved by suppressing competitors, thereby rendering them less intelligible in noise. In a series of experiments using a paradigm adapted from Healey, Hasher, and Campbell (2013), we presented a list of words that included target/competitor pairs of orthographically similar words (e.g., ALLERGY and ANALOGY). After a delay, participants solved fragments (e.g., A_L__GY), some of which resembled both members of the target/competitor pair, but could only be completed by the target. We then assessed the consequence of having successfully resolved this interference by asking participants to identify words in noise, some of which included the rejected competitor words from the previous phase. Consistent with a suppression account of interference resolution, younger adults reliably demonstrated reduced identification accuracy for competitors, indicating that they had effectively rejected, and therefore suppressed, competitors. In contrast, older adults showed a relative increase in accuracy for competitors relative to young adults. Such results suggest that older adults' reduced ability to suppress these representations resulted in sustained access to lexical traces, subsequently increasing perceptual identification of such items. We discuss these findings within the framework of inhibitory control theory in cognitive aging and its implications for age-related changes in speech perception.","2017-09","2018-12-21 16:25:15","2018-12-21 16:25:15","","572-587","","6","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; interference; speech perception; suppression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These included divergent thinking, caption-writing, an essay, and self-report measures of creativity in numerous domains. Creativity scores were compared to data from the college application, including high school rank, standardized test scores, and admissions interview scores. Results showed that traditional admissions criteria were only weakly related to creativity. Indeed, students who report the highest creative self-efficacy can be perceived as weaker applicants according to traditional criteria.

These included family identification, or a sense of belonging to and commonality with family members, and family constraints, or the extent to which family members are closed, judgmental, or unreceptive in conversations about cancer. We also tested the hypothesis that family constraints mediate the relationship between family identification and cancer-related posttraumatic stress. MethodsWe used a cross-sectional design. Surveys were collected from 205 colorectal cancer survivors in Tayside, Scotland. ResultsBoth family identification and family constraints were stronger independent predictors of posttraumatic stress than social support. In multivariate analyses, social support was not a significant independent predictor of posttraumatic stress. In addition, there was a significant indirect effect of family identification on posttraumatic stress through family constraints. ConclusionsNumerous studies demonstrate a link between social support and posttraumatic stress. However, experiences within the family may be more important in predicting posttraumatic stress after cancer. Furthermore, a sense of belonging to and commonality with the family may reduce the extent to which cancer survivors experience constraints on conversations about cancer; this may, in turn, reduce posttraumatic stress.","2017-09","2018-12-21 16:25:17","2018-12-21 16:25:17","","1330-1335","","9","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cancer; oncology; posttraumatic stress; social constraints; social identification; social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the second quartile phenomenon was the result of first-quartile female athletes registering to play male sport. Due to the nature of the collected data, a secondary purpose was to examine relative age effects across female age divisions. Design: Cross-sectional, with multiple chi-square analyses. Method: Players included 29,924 female ice hockey players (ages 7-17 years) from the Ontario Hockey Federation. Birthdates were converted into quartiles following the Hockey Canada selection year. Results: Relative age effects (with the second quartile most over-represented) existed for the entire sample (chi(2) [3, 29923] = 401.95, p < 0.001), those registered for female ice hockey (chi(2) [3, 24984] = 369.90, p < 0.001) and those registered for male ice hockey (chi(2) [3, 4938] = 37.88, p < 0.001). The strength of the effect lessened as athletes aged. Conclusion: It appears the second-quartile phenomenon cannot be explained by athletes' choice to play male sport. Further, female relative age effects appear strongest at younger ages. The discussion includes integration of results with previous literature, along with plausible explanations.

However, no prior studies have examined the relation between police victimization and PEs. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to police victimization (ie, physical, sexual, psychological, and neglect) would be associated with increased odds for PEs in the Survey of Police-Public Encounters data (N = 1615), a general population sample of adults from 4 US cities. Respondents who reported each type of police victimization were more likely to report PEs in logistic regression analyses (all P <.01), most of which were significant even when adjusting for demographic variables, psychological distress, and self-reported crime involvement (adjusted OR range: 1.30 to 7.16). Furthermore, the prevalence of PEs increased with greater exposure to police victimization in a linear dose-response relation, OR (95% CI) = 1.44 (1.24-1.66). These findings suggest that police victimization is a clinically important and previously unreported risk factor for PEs in the urban US population. These findings support the need for community-based outreach efforts and greater police training to reduce the prevalence of this exposure, particularly in socially disadvantaged urban communities.","2017-09","2018-12-21 16:25:18","2018-12-21 16:25:18","","993-1001","","5","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","epidemiology; police abuse; psychosis; schizophrenia; social defeat; victimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tested extensively in non-psychiatric populations, Berry's framework generally suggests that integration, or engagement with both the host and minority culture, is most adaptive. Using the Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AMAS), we tested the hypothesis that individuals with schizophrenia who employed an integrative acculturation strategy would have the highest QoL and lowest symptom severity, followed by the assimilation and enculturation groups, then the marginalized group. Psychiatric symptoms and QoL were regressed on AMAS assimilation scores, enculturation scores, and the interaction term in a sample of 128 Hispanic and Blacks with schizophrenia (M age = 41.28; 70% male). Acculturation strategy was not found to relate to psychiatric symptoms (measured from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale). However, acculturation strategy did predict QoL (measured from the Quality of Life Inventory), and results were in line with Berry's model.

In the current study, we test the hypothesis that less efficient task control in individuals diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with OCD symptoms, and specifically, with the inability to inhibit unwanted behaviors in OCD. Thirty-five healthy controls, 30 participants with OCD, and 26 participants with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) completed the object-interference (01) task to measure task control, the stop-signal task to measure response inhibition, and the arrow-flanker task to evaluate executive abilities not contingent upon task control. OCD patients, but not GAD patients or healthy controls, exhibited impaired performance on the OI task. The deficit in task control, but not in response inhibition, correlated with OCD symptom severity. We suggest that reduced task control may be one of the neurocognitive processes that underlie the inability to inhibit unwanted behaviors in OCD.","2017-09","2018-12-21 16:25:22","2018-12-21 16:25:22","","603-613","","5","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive performance; executive functions; inhibitory control; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); task control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, mechanisms that may explain their comorbidity are not well known. Method: The present study tested the hypothesis that insomnia would exert an indirect effect on negative reinforcement smoking processes via emotion dysregulation among 126 adult non-treatment seeking daily smokers (55 females; M-age = 44.1 years, SD = 9.72). Negative reinforcement smoking processes included negative reinforcement smoking outcome expectancies, negative reinforcement smoking motives, and two negative expectancies from brief smoking abstinence (somatic symptoms and harmful consequences). Results: Insomnia symptoms yielded a significant indirect effect through emotion dysregulation for negative reinforcement smoking outcome expectancies, negative reinforcement smoking motives, and harmful consequences expectancies from brief smoking abstinence. In contrast to prediction, however, insomnia was not associated with somatic symptom expectancies from brief smoking abstinence through emotion dysregulation. Conclusions: These data may suggest that the indirect effect of emotion dysregulation is more relevant to cognitive-affective negative reinforcement processes rather than somatic states. Overall, the present findings contribute to a growing body of literature linking emotion dysregulation as an explanatory mechanism for insomnia and smoking and uniquely extend such work to an array of clinically significant negative reinforcement smoking processes.

A Psychological Experiment","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01410","","Have you ever noticed that in watch advertisements the time is usually set at 10:10? The reasons and psychological effects of this default time setting are elusive. In Experiment 1, we hypothesized that watches showing a time setting resembling a smiling face (10:10) would enhance emotional valence and intention to buy compared to a neutral time setting (11:30), whereas a time setting resembling a sad face (8:20) would have the opposite effect. Moreover, we investigated a possible interaction effect with the gender of the participants. In Experiment 2, we directly tested the hypotheses that watches set at 10:10 resemble a smiling face, whereas watches set at 8:20 resemble a sad face. The data of the first experiment reveal that watches set at 10:10 showed a significant positive effect on the emotion of the observer and the intention to buy. However, watches set at 8:20 did not show any effect on the emotion or the intention to buy. Moreover, watches set at 10:10 induced in women significantly stronger ratings of pleasure than in men. The data of the second experiment show that participants consistently perceive high resemblance between watches set at 10:10 and a smiling face as well as high resemblance between watches set at 8:20 and a sad face. This study provides for the first time empirical evidence for the notion that using watches with a time setting resembling a smiling face (like 10:10) can positively affect the emotional response of the observers and their evaluation of a seen watch, even though they are not aware of the fact that the shown time setting is inducing this effect. Practical implications of the observed findings and alternative explanations are discussed.","2017-08-23","2018-12-21 16:25:23","2018-12-21 16:25:23","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","emotion; face perception; neuromarketing; product design; subliminal perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concerning soccer, game-location affects positively the secondary and tertiary level of performance; however, there are fewer evidences about its effect on game structure (primary level of performance). This study aimed to detect the effect of game location on a primary level of performance in soccer. In particular, the objective was to reveal the hidden structures underlying the attack actions, in both home and away matches played by a top club (Serie A 2012/2013-First Leg). The methodological approach was based on systematic observation, supported by digital recordings and T-pattern analysis. Data were analyzed with THEME 6.0 software. A quantitative analysis, with nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and descriptive statistics, was carried out to test the hypotheses. A qualitative analysis on complex patterns was performed to get in-depth information on the game structure. This study showed that game tactics were significantly different, with home matches characterized by a more structured and varied game than away matches. In particular, a higher number of different patterns, with a higher level of complexity and including more unique behaviors was detected in home matches than in the away ones. No significant differences were found in the number of events coded per game between the two conditions. THEME software, and the corresponding T-pattern detection algorithm, enhance research opportunities by going further than frequency-based analyses, making this method an effective tool in supporting sport performance analysis and training.","2017-08-21","2018-12-21 16:25:24","2018-12-21 16:25:24","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","analysis of observational data; game location; soccer; sport performance analysis; T-Patterns","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, young people with ADHD, given an identical practice, were shown to improve online but expressed much smaller delayed gains overnight. As delayed gains in performance are taken to reflect procedural (”how to”) memory consolidation processes, this may explain skill learning deficits in persons with ADHD. However, motor training is usually provided in morning sessions, and, given that persons with ADHD are often evening types, chronobiological constraints may constitute a hidden factor. Here, we tested the hypothesis that evening training, compared to morning training, would result in larger overnight consolidation gains following practice on a novel motor task in young women with ADHD. Participants with (N = 25) and without ( N = 24) ADHD were given training on a finger opposition sequence tapping task, either in the morning or at evening. Performance was assessed before and immediately after training, overnight, and at 2 weeks post-training. Individuals with ADHD reported a general preference for evening hours. Evening training was equally effective in participants with and without ADHD, both groups showing robust consolidation gains in task performance overnight. However, the ability to express delayed gains overnight was significantly reduced in participants with ADHD if trained in the morning. Typical peers were as effective in expressing overnight consolidation phase gains irrespective of the time-of-day wherein the training session was afforded. Nevertheless, even after morning training, participants with ADHD fully retained the gains acquired within the first 24 h over an interval of about 2 weeks. Our results suggest that procedural memory consolidation processes are extant and effective in ADHD, but require that specific biobehavioral conditions be met. The affordance of training in the evening hours can relax some of the constraints on these processes in ADHD. The current results are in line with the notion that the control of what is to be retained in procedural memory is atypical or more stringent in ADHD.","2017-08-03","2018-12-21 16:25:25","2018-12-21 16:25:25","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; chronotype; consolidation; evening training; motor sequence; procedural learning; training schedule; young adults","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: This was a cross-sectional mailed survey with a national sample of veterans with spinal cord injuries and disorders (n = 565), which included measures of demographics, perceived environmental barriers, participation, resilience, grief or loss, and self-efficacy. Data were analyzed using a latent variable path analysis; the model fit was assessed using chi(2), normed chi(2), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; < 0.07), Comparative Fit Index (CFI; >= 0.95), and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI; >= 0.95). Results: Participants were mostly male (93.9%), Caucasian or White (74.2%), and, on average, 62.4 years of age (SD = 10.48). Almost 62% had paraplegia, and 38.3% had a motor or sensory complete injury. The hypothesized model showed excellent fit, chi(2)(42) = 153.40, normed chi(2) = 3.65, RMSEA = 0.07, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95. To assess for full mediation, a direct path was added from environment to participation. This model showed nearly identical fit, chi(2)(41) = 153.39, normed chi(2) = 3.74, RMSEA = 0.07, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95; the path from environment to participation was not significant, unstandardized coefficient = -0.04, p = .92. Examination of indirect effects of the hypothesized model demonstrated that environment significantly influences participation through psychosocial factors, unstandardized coefficient = -4.85, p <.001. Together these results support full mediation. Conclusions: In conclusion the present study expands upon past research by suggesting that perceived environmental barriers play a role in internal factors, such as resilience and self-efficacy, which in turn influence participation. Interventions to improve environmental barriers may be warranted, but attention must also be paid to resilience, grief or loss, and self-efficacy to increase participation.","2017-08","2018-12-21 16:25:26","2018-12-21 16:25:26","","334-344","","3","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","environmental barriers; participation; spinal cord injuries; veterans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results showed that parents' perceptions of over- or underpraising (vs. accurately praising) their children's schoolwork predicted poorer school performance and higher depression in children. From children's perspectives, perceived under- and overpraise by parents predicted poorer school performance and higher depression. However, when children felt that their parents' praise was slightly (but not majorly) overstated, this had at least as beneficial effects as when they felt the praise accurately reflected reality.

Emerging strategies to enhance exposure therapy in humans and fear extinction retention in animal models are primarily pharmacological. These approaches are limited as many patients report preferring non-pharmacological approaches in therapy. With general cognitive enhancement effects, exercise has emerged as a plausible non-pharmacological augmentation strategy. The present study tested the hypothesis that fear extinction and exposure therapy would be enhanced by a pre-training bout of exercise. Methods: We conducted four experiments with rats that involved a standardized conditioning and extinction paradigm and a manipulation of exercise. In a fifth experiment, we manipulated vigorous-intensity exercise prior to a standardized virtual reality exposure therapy session among adults with fear of heights. Results: In experiments 1-4, exercise did not facilitate fear extinction, long-term memory, or fear relapse tests. In experiment 5, human participants showed an overall reduction in fear of heights but exercise did not enhance symptom improvement. Conclusions: Although acute exercise prior to fear extinction or exposure therapy, as operationalized in the present 5 studies, did not enhance outcomes, these results must be interpreted within the context of a broader literature that includes positive findings. Taken all together, this suggests that more research is necessary to identify optimal parameters and key individual differences so that exercise can be implemented successfully to treat anxiety disorders.","2017-08","2018-12-21 16:25:28","2018-12-21 16:25:28","","76-86","","","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Acrophobia; Augmentation; Exercise; Exposure therapy; Fear extinction; Virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there is knowledge about the moderators of the depression-obesity association, our understanding of the potential behavioral and cognitive mediators that may explain the relationship between depression and obesity, is scarcely researched. The aim of this study is to investigate the mediating role of emotional eating and dichotomous thinking in the depression-obesity relationship. Data on 205 individuals from a community-based study conducted at Maastricht University, Netherlands were used. Self-reported data on depression, emotional eating and dichotomous thinking were collected and BMI scores were calculated in a cross-sectional research design. Correlations between variables were calculated. The primary analysis tested the hypothesis that depression has an effect on BMI through dichotomous thinking and emotional eating. A two-mediator model was used to predict the direct and indirect effects of emotional eating and dichotomous thinking on the depression-BMI relationship. Depression was positively correlated with BMI (r = 0.21, p = 0.005), emotional eating (r = 0.38, p < 0.001) and dichotomous thinking (r = 0.49, p < 0.001). Dichotomous thinking and emotional eating were positively correlated with BMI (r = 0.35, p < 0.001; and r = 0.45, p < 0.001 respectively). Both dichotomous thinking (Z = 2.54, p = 0.01, 95% confidence intervals = 0.01-0.17) and emotional eating (Z = 3.92 p < 0.001, 95% confidence intervals = 0.06-0.19) could explain the depression-BMI relationship. The assessment of emotional eating and dichotomous thinking might be useful in guiding assessment and treatment protocols for weight management. The present study adds to the existing literature on the role of dysfunctional cognitions and emotions on eating behavior, and particularly to the factors that may impede people's ability to control their eating.

The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that pain-related anxiety would predict early lapse and relapse to cigarette smoking. These data were collected in the context of a primary study examining the role of emotional vulnerabilities in smoking cessation. The current analyses were conducted among 55 daily cigarette smokers who attempted to quit without psychosocial or pharmacological cessation aids. Pain-related anxiety was assessed at baseline using the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale-20 (PASS-20). Early lapse and relapse were assessed using timeline follow-back procedures. Cox regression analyses indicated that pain-related anxiety was a significant predictor of both early smoking lapse and relapse such that for every 1-point increase on the PASS-20, the risk of early lapse increased by 3.7% and the risk of early relapse increased by 3.6%. These effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by tobacco dependence, past 4-week pain severity, anxiety sensitivity, and the presence of current Axis I psychopathology. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses further revealed that among early lapsers, greater pain-related anxiety predicted a more rapid trajectory to lapse. Pain-related anxiety was also a significant predictor of early lapse when the sample was limited to smokers with past 4-week pain. These findings lend empirical support to the notion that pain-related anxiety may contribute to the maintenance of tobacco dependence among smokers who experience varying levels of pain intensity.","2017-08","2018-12-21 16:25:30","2018-12-21 16:25:30","","255-264","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","pain; pain-related anxiety; smoking; smoking cessation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attentional avoidance of food might help AN patients to prevent more elaborate processing of food stimuli and the subsequent generation of craving, which might enable AN patients to maintain their strict diet. Participants were 66 restrictive AN spectrum patients and 55 healthy controls. A single-target rapid serial visual presentation task was used with food and disorder-neutral cues as critical distracter stimuli and disorder-neutral pictures as target stimuli. AN spectrum patients showed diminished task performance when visual food cues were presented in close temporal proximity of the to-be-identified target. In contrast to our hypothesis, results indicate that food cues automatically capture AN spectrum patients' attention. One explanation could be that the enhanced attentional capture of food cues in AN is driven by the relatively high threat value of food items in AN. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed. General Scientific Summary The current study tested the hypothesis that people with anorexia nervosa show attentional avoidance of food. This might help them to persist in their restrictive food intake.

Experiments 1b and 2 separate physical causality from moral valuation by varying whether the victim is a person or animal and whether the harmful action rescues people or inanimate objects. The results show that people's moral judgments lead them to portray a causal event as either more or less direct and intended, which in turn shapes their verb choices.

Here, we present a computational model of Persian character recognition based on deep belief networks, where increasingly more complex visual features emerge in a completely unsupervised manner by fitting a hierarchical generative model to the sensory data. Crucially, high-level internal representations emerging from unsupervised deep learning can be easily read out by a linear classifier, achieving state-of-the-art recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that handwritten digits and letters share many common visual features: A generative model that captures the statistical structure of the letters distribution should therefore also support the recognition of written digits. To this aim, deep networks trained on Persian letters were used to build high-level representations of Persian digits, which were indeed read out with high accuracy. Our simulations show that complex visual features, such as those mediating the identification of Persian symbols, can emerge from unsupervised learning in multilayered neural networks and can support knowledge transfer across related domains.","2017-08","2018-12-21 16:25:32","2018-12-21 16:25:32","","273-284","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Computational modeling; Hierarchical generative models; Persian character recognition; Transfer learning; Unsupervised deep learning; Visual pattern recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given its voluntary nature and potential for positive outcomes, the appropriateness and feasibility of VOM after serious offenses is subject to debate in the literature. In light of this discussion, this study first aimed to unravel the prevalence of serious offenses in cases registered for VOM and examined whether crime seriousness predicts whether mediated contact is reached between victims and offenders. Second, it tested the hypothesis that victims of increasingly serious, harmful crimes are more willing to participate when more time has elapsed since the offense-in contrast to victims of less serious, harmful crimes. We analyzed 199 cases registered for VOM in the Netherlands and coded the perceived wrongfulness, harmfulness, and average duration of incarceration of an offense as 3 distinct indicators of crime seriousness in these cases. The findings revealed that cases registered for VOM (a) are, in terms of the incarceration duration, on average more serious than all offenses in the population, and (b) resulted in mediated contact (or not) independently of the 3 seriousness indicators. In addition, empirical support was found for the hypothesis that victims' willingness to participate in VOM increased over time after more harmful offenses, whereas it decreased when offenses inflicted less harm. These findings suggest that when VOM programs operate irrespectively of the time elapsed after crime, mediated contact between parties may be as likely after minor and serious offenses.","2017-08","2018-12-21 16:25:33","2018-12-21 16:25:33","","385-397","","4","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","crime seriousness; participation; restorative justice; time elapsed; victim-offender mediation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that major depressive disorder affects the diurnal variation of salivary aldosterone and that aldosterone concentrations reflect the duration and severity of the depressive episode in a sex dependent manner. The sample consisted of 60 patients (37 post-menopausal women, 23 men) with major depressive disorder. Patients were examined two times, in acute depressive episode (admission to the hospital) and after reaching clinical remission (discharge). The samples of saliva were taken by the patients themselves twice a day (8.00-9.00 h in the morning and in the evening). Aldosterone concentrations were significantly higher in women compared to men and were significantly higher at the time of admission to the hospital compared to those at the discharge. Morning but not evening salivary aldosterone concentrations reflected the length of the depressive episode in women as well as the severity of the disorder in both sexes. Moreover, the patients with depression failed to exert known daily rhythmicity of aldosterone release. The present study brings several pieces of evidence suggesting the association of aldosterone with the pathophysiology of depression. Salivary aldosterone concentrations appear to reflect the outcome, the duration and the severity of the depressive episode in a sex dependent manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A multilevel confirmatory analysis was used to provide evidence that variables of this study are distinct and a HLM analysis to test the hypotheses. We find that employees' perception of inclusion is influenced much more by an offensive humor climate than by a positive one. The results also suggest that the perception of inclusion plays a significant intermediary role in the influence of humor climates on citizenship behavior. Finally, trust in leaders acts as an important contingent condition in the effectiveness of a humor climate. Use of humor does not always pay. Offensive humor by supervisor is a risky strategy that may undermine the beneficial effects of positive humor climate, increase employee exclusion and weaker individual performance. Our study shows the utility of using micro- and macro-approaches, and more specifically, the relevance of adopting an integrative multilevel view of the effect of a humor environment in predicting individual inclusion and citizenship behaviors.","2017-08","2018-12-21 16:25:36","2018-12-21 16:25:36","","363-378","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Humor; Inclusion; Leadership; OCB; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was the first to examine in a single model whether callous, uncaring, and unemotional traits are directly related to the perpetration of bullying and to harm-effect moral reasoning in bullying among children as well as whether these three CU traits are indirectly related to bullying mediated by harm-effect moral reasoning. Self-reported data on CU traits, harm-effect moral reasoning in bullying situations, and bullying perpetration were collected from 381 children from 13 schools in Sweden. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. When all three sub-constructs of CU traits were included in a single model, greater callousness and uncaring were directly associated with greater bullying. In contrast, greater harm-effect moral reasoning was associated with less bullying. Moreover, greater callousness and unemotional were indirectly associated with greater bullying through the reduced use of harm-effect moral reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that all three CU traits are important to address, although their associations with bullying took some different paths, and that callousness appears to be the most important CU trait in relation to bullying.","2017-08","2018-12-21 16:25:37","2018-12-21 16:25:37","","559-575","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bullying; Callous-unemotional traits; Moral reasoning; Psychopathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, research has also demonstrated that testing enhances subsequent learning (e.g., Tulving & Watkins, 1974; Wissman, Rawson, & Pyc, 2011). The goal of the present study was to examine these seemingly contradictory effects of testing. In two experiments we tested the hypothesis that testing influences how post-test information is processed. Depending on the nature of the later memory test, test-related processing can result in either memory errors or enhanced learning effects. Experiment 1 indicated that testing may result in elaborative processing of post-test material, resulting an increase in misinformation suggestibility. Experiment 2 suggested that increased suggestibility after testing may be understood as test-related learning of post-test material. Taken together, the results suggest that interim testing occurring between an original event and post-event misinformation may enhance memory suggestibility, because testing results in elaborative processing of subsequent material. However, interim testing also helps segregate memory for each source, resulting in test-potentiated learning within the misinformation paradigm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The current study examined the persistence of this overlap over time. Furthermore, we aimed to better understand why the language profiles of these two groups show resemblance, testing the hypothesis that the language difficulties of children with LI reflect a weakened ability to maintain attention to the stream of linguistic information. Consequent incomplete processing of language input may lead to delays that are similar to those originating from reductions in input frequency. Methods: Monolingual and bilingual children with and without LI (N = 128), aged 5-8 years old, participated in this study. Dutch receptive vocabulary and grammatical morphology were assessed at three waves. In addition, auditory and visual sustained attention were tested at wave 1. Mediation analyses were performed to examine relationships between LI, sustained attention, and language skills. Results: Children with LI and bilingual children were outperformed by their typically developing (TD) and monolingual peers, respectively, on vocabulary and morphology at all three waves. The vocabulary difference between monolinguals and bilinguals decreased over time. In addition, children with LI had weaker auditory and visual sustained attention skills relative to TD children, while no differences between monolinguals and bilinguals emerged. Auditory sustained attention mediated the effect of LI on vocabulary and morphology in both the monolingual and bilingual groups of children. Visual sustained attention only acted as a mediator in the bilingual group. Conclusion: The findings from the present study indicate that the overlap between the language profiles of children with LI and bilingual children is particularly large for vocabulary in early (pre) school years and reduces over time. Results furthermore suggest that the overlap may be explained by the weakened ability of children with LI to sustain their attention to auditory stimuli, interfering with how well incoming language is processed.","2017-07-21","2018-12-21 16:25:38","2018-12-21 16:25:38","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bilingualism; language impairment; morphology; sustained attention; vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Etiological explanations of BPD include the experience of early adversity, but how this impacts on risk-taking and impulsivity in relation to sexuality and mating has remained elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that people with BPD adopt a “fast” life history strategy which impacts their mate choice and sexual behavior. Sixty female patients with BPD and 45 controls were given 3 hypothetical vignettes depicting a “Predictably Safe”, an “Unpredictably Safe-Risky”, and a “Predictably Risky” life conditions, requiring the participant to put herself imaginatively into the described situation. Participants also completed questionnaires about their psychosexual development, depressiveness, and childhood experiences. Patients with BPD were significantly more likely to expect less parental investment from their hypothetical partners in the predictably safe condition, and to consent to sexual affairs at an earlier age than controls. Correlation analyses suggest that subjective depressiveness, childhood trauma, rearing style of patients' parents, and actual psychosexual development impacted on mate choice in the hypothetical scenarios. In addition, findings may also corroborate ideas of nonrandom mating in patients with BPD, which may be taken into consideration when interpersonal difficulties with romantic partners are dealt with in psychotherapy.

Suicidality is a recognised complication of epilepsy. As part of developing an integrated service for people with epilepsy (PWE) and priority psychiatric disorders within primary care, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural district in Ethiopia to investigate patterns of help-seeking, suicidality and the association with duration of untreated epilepsy (DUE) among PWE. Methods: Cases were identified through community key informants and diagnosis was confirmed by trained primary care clinicians. Severity of epilepsy, depression and suicidality were assessed using standardised methods. Multivariable regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis that suicidality was associated with DUE. Results: The majority of PWE sought help from both religious and biomedical healing centres. The lifetime treatment gap for biomedical care was 26.9%, with a 12 month treatment gap of 56.7%. Close to one-third (29.9%) of participants reported using traditional and cultural healing practices. Nearly one-third (30.2%) of participants reported suicidality (suicidal ideation, plan or attempt) in the previous 1 year. The median (IQR) DUE was 24 months (4-72). There was no association between DUE and suicidality. In the multivariable model, being married [odds ratio (OR) 2.81, 95% CI 1.22, 6.46], increased depressive symptoms (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.10, 1.26) and perceived poorer wealth relative to others (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.07, 6.68) were associated independently with suicidality. Conclusion: In this study, PWE sought help from both biomedical and religious healing centres. Suicidality and depression have a high prevalence in PWE in this setting. Integrated mental and neurological health care within primary care is needed for improved holistic management of epilepsy.","2017-07-14","2018-12-21 16:25:40","2018-12-21 16:25:40","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Depression; Help seeking; Low income country; Suicidality; Untreated epilepsy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The amendments were intended to remove perceived obstacles to the detention of high risk patients with personality disorders (PDs), sexual deviance and learning disabilities (LDs). The AMEND study aimed to test the hypothesis that the implementation of these changes would lead to an increase in numbers or proportions of patients with these conditions who would be assessed and detained under the MHA 2007. Method: A prospective, quantitative study of MHA assessments undertaken between July-October 2008-11 at three English sites. Data were collected from local forms used for MHA assessment documentation and patient electronic databases. Results: The total number of assessments in each four month period of data collection varied: 1034 in 2008, 1042 in 2009, 1242 in 2010 and 1010 in 2011 (n = 4415). Of the assessments 65.6% resulted in detention in 2008, 71.3% in 2009, 64.7% in 2010 and 63.5% in 2011.

However, data on a direct relation between 5-HTTLPR and in vivo 5-HTT availability have been inconsistent. Additional factors such as epigenetic modifications of 5-HTTLPR might contribute to this association. This is of particular interest in the context of obesity, as an association with 5-HTTLPR hypermethylation has previously been reported. Here, we tested the hypothesis that methylation rates of 14 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) 5-HTTLPR loci, in vivo central 5-HTT availability as measured with [C-11] DASB positron emission tomography (PET) and body mass index (BMI) are related in a group of 30 obese (age: 36 +/- 3 10 years, BMI435 kg/m(2)) and 14 normal-weight controls (age 36 +/- 7 years, BMI < 25 kg/m(2)). No significant association between 5-HTTLPR methylation and BMI overall was found. However, site-specific elevations in 5-HTTLPR methylation rates were significantly associated with lower 5-HTT availability in regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) specifically within the obese group when analyzed in isolation. This association was independent of functional 5-HTTLPR allelic variation. In addition, negative correlative data showed that CpG10-associated 5-HTT availability determines levels of reward sensitivity in obesity. Together, our findings suggest that epigenetic mechanisms rather than 5-HTTLPR alone influence in vivo 5-HTT availability, predominantly in regions having a critical role in reward processing, and this might have an impact on the progression of the obese phenotype.","2017-07-04","2018-12-21 16:25:41","2018-12-21 16:25:41","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The skin acts as an important anatomical barrier, yet little research has investigated the role of tactile sensitivity in disease avoidance. Increased tactile sensitivity in the presence of potential sources of pathogens may facilitate prophylactic behaviors such as self-grooming. Across multiple studies, we tested the hypothesis that the induction of disgust-the key emotion underlying disease avoidance-may lead to greater tactile sensitivity compared to control conditions. A nonsignificant trend was found in a pilot study, which was replicated (and found to be significant) in Studies 1 and 2. To our knowledge, these results are the first to demonstrate disgust-induced changes in tactile sensitivity, and they contribute to the growing literature on the integrated evolved defenses against infectious disease.","2017-07","2018-12-21 16:25:42","2018-12-21 16:25:42","","40-45","","","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Behavioral immune system; Disease avoidance; Disgust; Tactile sensitivity; Threat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies on explanatory mechanisms driving social dysfunctions in patients' real-life relationships are, however, lacking. Here, we aimed to investigate one of the most central aspects of close relationships, interpersonal trust, in romantic relationships of persons with BPD. We tested the hypothesis that patients with BPD show unstable trustworthiness perception toward their partner, which we expected to be most pronounced after a relationship-threatening situation. Thirty-one heterosexual couples in which the women were diagnosed with BPD and 36 healthy control (HC) couples (total N = 134) each discussed three different topics that where (a) neutral (favorite films), (b) personally threatening (personal fears), and (c) relationship threatening (possible reasons for separation from partner). Trustworthiness appraisal of the partner was assessed after each conversation by self-report. BPD patients did not differ from HC women on trustworthiness perception after the neutral conversation but reported diminished trustworthiness perception after both threatening situations compared to HCs. BPD patients' trustworthiness perception was by trend decreased after the separation versus fear condition. The perceived tenderness in the relationship was a protective factor. The inability to maintain a stable image of a trustworthy partner during threatening situations might lead to difficulties in interpersonal relationships of patients with BPD. Although relationship threats possibly play a particular role in this context, trustworthiness perception decreases are not limited to this kind of threat.","2017-07","2018-12-21 16:25:42","2018-12-21 16:25:42","","281-286","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","borderline personality disorder; romantic relationships; social interaction; threat; trustworthiness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As religious people are more likely than less-religious people to perceive faces in everyday objects and as perception of face-like objects promotes prosociality, it was expected that religious people would become more prosocial when they perceived face-like objects. To test the hypothesis, the study replicated a past finding in a Japanese sample in which religious people tended to perceive a face in everyday objects. Next, results showed that the decision to donate in religious people (compared to less-religious people) was increased when a face-like object was displayed with charitable appeals. This effect was not observed with a non-face-like object. The current study indicates that interaction with the surrounding environment plays an important role in motivating prosocial behavior among religious people.","2017-07","2018-12-21 16:25:44","2018-12-21 16:25:44","","221-229","","3","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anthropomorphism; being watched; prosociality; religion; religiosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moderators of longitudinal risks for depression and anxiety","PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE","","0033-2917","10.1017/S0033291717000253","","Background. High neuroticism is a well-established risk for present and future depression and anxiety, as well as an emerging target for treatment and prevention. The current analyses tested the hypothesis that physical, social and socio-economic disadvantages each amplify risks from high neuroticism for longitudinal increases in depression and anxiety symptoms. Method. A national sample of adults (n = 7108) provided structured interview and questionnaire data in the Midlife Development in the United States Survey. Subsamples were reassessed roughly 9 and 18 years later. Time-lagged multilevel models predicted changes in depression and anxiety symptom intensity across survey waves. Results. High neuroticism predicted increases in a depression/anxiety symptom composite across retest intervals. Three disadvantage dimensions - physical limitations (e.g. chronic illness, impaired functioning), social problems (e.g. less social support, more social strain) and low socio-economic status (e.g. less education, lower income) - each moderated risks from high neuroticism for increases in depression and anxiety symptoms. Collectively, high scores on the three disadvantage dimensions amplified symptom increases attributable to high neuroticism by 0.67 standard deviations. In contrast, neuroticism was not a significant risk for increases in symptoms among participants with few physical limitations, few social problems or high socio-economic status. Conclusions. Risks from high neuroticism are not shared equally among adults in the USA. Interventions preventing or treating depression or anxiety via neuroticism could be targeted toward vulnerable subpopulations with physical, social or socio-economic disadvantages. Moreover, decreasing these disadvantages may reduce mental health risks from neuroticism.","2017-07","2018-12-21 16:25:45","2018-12-21 16:25:45","","1794-1805","","10","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anxiety; depression; moderators; neuroticism; risk factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depending on the studies, the egalitarian norm was experimentally manipulated or induced and kept constant. Group distinctiveness was manipulated through scientific support for the theory that a person's sexual orientation is determined by biological factors in terms of the extant biological differences (high distinctiveness) versus biological similarities (low distinctiveness) between heterosexual and gay people. Egalitarian norms increased men's (but not women's) intergroup differentiation (Study 1) and prejudice (Study 2) when group distinctiveness was low (as compared to high).

These findings suggest that an intervention that reduces reward and attention region response and increases inhibitory control region response to such foods might reduce overeating. We conducted a randomized pilot experiment that tested the hypothesis that a multi-faceted food response and attention training with personalized high and low-calorie food images would produce changes in behavioral and neural responses to food images and body fat compared to a control training with non-food images among community-recruited over-weight/obese adults. Compared to changes observed in controls, completing the intervention was associated with significant reductions in reward and attention region response to high-calorie food images (Mean Cohen's d = 1.54), behavioral evidence of learning, reductions in palatability ratings and monetary valuation of high-calorie foods (p = 0.009, d's = 0.92), and greater body fat loss over a 4-week period (p = 0.009, d = 0.90), though body fat effects were not significant by 6-month follow-up. Results suggest that this multifaceted response and attention training intervention was associated with reduced reward and attention region responsivity to food cues, and a reduction in body fat. Because this implicit training treatment is both easy and inexpensive to deliver, and does not require top-down executive control that is necessary for negative energy balance obesity treatment, it may prove useful in treating obesity if future studies can determine how to create more enduring effects.

Guided by the investment model of commitment processes, we hypothesized that sexual partner commitment is a function of satisfaction with, alternatives to, and investments in the relationship. Commitment to a sexual partner is, in turn, associated with reduced perceptions of vulnerability to sexually transmitted infection acquisition, which results in lowered condom use intentions and use.

Oxytocin is a hypothalamic peptide that contributes to maternal infant bonding and has diverse pro-social effects in adults This study tested the hypothesis that 12 weeks of intranasal oxytocin will improve social cognitive function in outpatients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Sixty-eight eligible participants were randomized to oxytocin (24 IU twice daily) or placebo. Social cognitive function was assessed using the Emotion Recognition-40, Brune Theory of Mind, Reading the Mind in the Eyes test Trustworthiness task and Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. In addition, social function was assessed using the Specific Levels of Functioning Scale and a role-play test, and psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Fifty-five participants completed the 12-week trial. The study found no evidence for a differential advantage of oxytocin over placebo on social cognition. Among secondary outcomes, there was a modest advantage for oxytocin over placebo on a component of social functioning, although there was also evidence that the placebo group outperformed the oxytocin group on the role-play task. No between-group differences emerged on measures of psychopathology in pre-specified comparisons, but oxytocin showed significant within-group reduction in PANSS negative symptoms and significant between-group improvement in negative symptoms in the schizophrenia subgroup. further testing is needed to clarify whether oxytocin has therapeutic potential for social cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia.

However, the mechanism by which sleep modifies emotional processing in early childhood is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that a nap, compared to an equivalent time spent awake, reduces biases in attention allocation to affective information. Children (n=43; M=55.40months, SD=8.05months) completed a Dot Probe task, which provides a measure of attention biases to emotional stimuli, following a mid-day nap and an equivalent interval spent awake. No emotional attention biases emerged when children napped. However, when nap-deprived, children exhibited biases towards negative and positive stimuli. This emotional bias after wake was greater in children who napped habitually. Gender differences also emerged such that females were more attentive to positive emotional stimuli whereas males showed heightened attention to negative emotional stimuli, regardless of having napped or not. Moreover, greater slow wave activity (SWA) during the nap was associated with faster responding, which suggests that SWA may promote efficiency of attention allocation.

Yet they have difficulty predicting a loved one's desire to receive treatments in hypothetical situations. We tested the hypothesis that this difficulty could in part be explained by discrepant quality-of-life assessments. Methods: The data come from 235 community-dwelling adults aged 70 years and over who rated their quality of life and desire for specified interventions in four health states (current state, mild to moderate stroke, incurable brain cancer, and severe dementia). All ratings were made on Likert-type scales. Using identical rating scales, a surrogate chosen by the older adult was asked to predict the latter's responses. Linear mixed models were fitted to determine whether differences in quality-of-life ratings between the older adult and surrogate were associated with surrogates' inaccuracy in predicting desire for treatment. Results: The difference in quality-of-life ratings was a significant predictor of prediction inaccuracy for the three hypothetical health states (p < 0.01) and nearly significant for the current health state (p = 0.077). All regression coefficients were negative, implying that the more the surrogate overestimated quality of life compared to the older adult, the more he or she overestimated the older adult's desire to be treated. Conclusion: Discrepant quality-of-life ratings are associated with surrogates' difficulty in predicting desire for life-sustaining interventions in hypothetical situations. This finding underscores the importance of discussing anticipated quality of life in states of cognitive decline, to better prepare family members for making difficult decisions for their loved ones.","2017-07","2018-12-21 16:25:51","2018-12-21 16:25:51","","1061-1068","","7","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agreement; cognitive impairment; concordance; elderly; healthcare; proxy; quality of life; substitute decision making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tested the hypothesis that adaptive treatment (AT) will improve outcomes for poor responders (PR) to evidence-based practice interventions. Method: A total of 161 adolescents, 13-18 years of age, diagnosed with DSM-IV CUD, enrolled in this outpatient, randomized, AT study. Following a 7-session weekly motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention (MET/CBT-7) only poor responders (defined as failing to achieve abstinence at week seven for any reason) were randomized into a 10-week AT phase of either an individualized enhanced CBT or an Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA) intervention. Good responders (GR) enrolled only in follow-up assessments starting at the completion of the AT phase (week 17). Results: Eighty adolescents (50%) met the criterion for poor response to treatment. Thirty seven percent of poor responders completed the AT phase and 27% of them achieved abstinence. There was no significant difference in retention and abstinence rates between the AT conditions.

Stressful childhood environments have been predicted to produce a life history strategy in which adults are oriented more toward short-term mating behaviors and less toward behaviors consistent with longevity. This article tests the hypothesis that adverse childhood environment will predict adult outcomes in two areas: risky sexual behavior (engagement in sexual risk behavior or having taken an HIV test) and marital status (currently married vs. never married, divorced, or a member of an unmarried couple). Data come from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The sample contains 17,530 men and 23,978 women aged 18-54 years living in 13 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia. Adverse childhood environment is assessed through 11 retrospective measures of childhood environment, including having grown up with someone who was depressed or mentally ill, who was an alcoholic, who used or abused drugs, or who served time in prison; whether one's parents divorced in childhood; and two scales measuring childhood exposure to violence and to sexual trauma. The results indicate that adverse childhood environment is associated with increased likelihood of engaging in sexual risk behaviors or taking an HIV test, and increased likelihood of being in an unmarried couple or divorced/separated, for both men and women. The predictions are supported by the data, lending further support to the hypothesis that childhood environments influence adult reproductive strategy.","2017-06-04","2018-12-21 16:25:53","2018-12-21 16:25:53","","","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","acceleration theory; adverse childhood environment; HIV test; marital status; sexual risk behaviors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 67 heterosexual couples were assessed on love language preference, self-regulation, and relationship satisfaction. Results provided limited evidence that love language alignment promotes satisfaction; self-regulation contributed greater variance in satisfaction. Dyadic analyses identified that female self-regulation positively impacted both male and female relationship satisfaction when couples had dissimilar primary love languages, although significant actor effects were also important predictors for both genders.

For example, a short glance at a person's face provides information about his or her identity and emotional state. What are the computations the brain uses to acquire this information so accurately and seemingly effortlessly? This article summarizes current research on computational modeling, a technique used to answer this question. Specifically, my research tests the hypothesis that this algorithm is tasked with solving the inverse problem of production. For example, to recognize identity, our brain needs to identify shape and shading features that are invariant to facial expression, pose, and illumination. Similarly, to recognize emotion, the brain needs to identify shape and shading features that are invariant to identity, pose, and illumination. If one defines the physics equations that render an image under different identities, expressions, poses, and illuminations, then gaining invariance to these factors can be readily resolved by computing the inverse of this rendering function. I describe our current understanding of the algorithms used by our brains to resolve this inverse problem. I also discuss how these results are driving research in computer vision to design computer systems that are as accurate, robust, and efficient as humans.","2017-06","2018-12-21 16:25:54","2018-12-21 16:25:54","","263-269","","3, SI","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affect; categorization; face processing; face recognition; language evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 36 out of 75 (48%) nightmares, 13 out of 46 (28.3%) unpleasant dreams, and 0 out of 1 diary entries the causal reference invoked by the CCs referred to group or social collective effects of some kind. In slightly more than half (56%) of the nightmares, 7% of unpleasant dreams, and 0% of diary entries containing CCs, the evaluative emotion was fear or terror. Colligatory concepts occur frequently in nightmares and dreams and most often refer causes of events in dreams to group or collective effects that are experienced as terrifying or disturbing.","2017-06","2018-12-21 16:25:55","2018-12-21 16:25:55","","148-160","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","colligatory concepts; dreams; historical consciousness; memory; nightmares","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, a belief in the negative affect-reducing qualities of nicotine may mediate this effect. The current study tested the hypothesis that negative reinforcing outcome expectancies mediate the relationship between negative affect on smoking susceptibility in nonusers, smoking frequency in users, and smoking experimentation in the overall sample. Results support the hypothesis that negative affect in alternative high school students is correlated with smoking experimentation, smoking willingness, and smoking frequency and that the relationship between negative affect and smoking behavior outcomes is mediated by negative reinforcing outcome expectancies (i.e., beliefs in the negative affect-reducing effects of smoking). This finding was supported for both cigarettes and electronic cigarettes and coincides with a rapid increase in the number of high school students nationally who have experimented with electronic cigarettes.

However, it is unknown to what extent environmental or genetic risk factors impact on CT in these populations. We have investigated the effect of Environmental Risk Scores (ERS) and Polygenic Risk Scores for SCZ (PGRS-SCZ) on CT. Structural MRI scans were acquired at 3T for patients with SCZ or BD (n = 57) and controls (n = 41). Cortical reconstructions were generated in FreeSurfer (v5.3). The ERS was created by determining exposure to cannabis use, childhood adverse events, migration, urbanicity and obstetric complications. The PGRS-SCZ were generated, for a subset of the sample (Patients = 43, HC = 32), based on the latest PGCGWAS findings. ANCOVAs were used to test the hypotheses that ERS and PGRS-SCZ relate to CT globally, and in frontal and temporal lobes. An increase in ERS was negatively associated with CT within temporal lobe for patients. A higher PGRS-SCZ was also related to global cortical thinning for patients. ERS effects remained significant when including PGRS-SCZ as a fixed effect. No relationship which survived FDR correction was found for ERS and PGRS-SCZ in controls. Environmental risk for SCZ was related to localised cortical thinning in patients with SCZ and BD, while increased PGRS-SCZ was associated with global cortical thinning. Genetic and environmental risk factors for SCZ appear therefore to have differential effects. This provides a mechanistic means by which different risk factors may contribute to the development of SCZ and BD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, studies investigating the association between diurnal cortisol rhythm and sleep patterns in young children are scarce. We tested the hypothesis that the diurnal cortisol rhythm is associated with shorter sleep duration and more sleep problems across early childhood. Methods This study was embedded in Generation R, a population-based cohort from fetal life onward. Parents collected saliva samples from their infant at five moments during day 1. In 322 infants aged 12 to 20 months, we determined the diurnal cortisol rhythm by calculating the area under the curve (AUC), the cortisol awakening response (CAR), and the diurnal slope. Sleep duration and sleep behavior were repeatedly assessed across ages of 14 months to 5 years. Generalized estimating equation models were used to assess related cortisol measures to sleep duration and sleep behavior. Results The diurnal cortisol slope and the CAR, but not the AUC, were associated with sleep duration across childhood. Children with flatter slopes and children with a more positive CAR were more likely to have shorter nighttime sleep duration ( per nmol/L/h slope = -0.12, 95% confidence interval = -0.19 to -0.05, p = .001; per nmol/L CAR = -0.01, 95% confidence interval = -0.02 to 0.00, p = .04). Cortisol measures did not predict sleep problems. Conclusions The present study suggests that a flatter diurnal cortisol slope and a more marked morning rise, which can indicate stress (or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation), have a long-term association with sleep regulation.","2017-06","2018-12-21 16:25:58","2018-12-21 16:25:58","","557-564","","5","79","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cohort; diurnal cortisol rhythm; HPA axis; infants; longitudinal; sleep duration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Descriptive analyses and LCA were performed separately for all three countries and compared. Four hundred and thirty-six children were included in the analysis (Australia n=70; Canada n=160; United Kingdom n=206). In each country, LCA revealed two distinct clusters, both of which presented with food avoidance.

However, mounting evidence challenges the meaning and utility of these putatively discrete alcohol trajectories, which can be analytically derived even in the absence of real subgroups. This study tests the hypothesis that alcohol trajectories may not reflect discrete groups that the development of alcohol use is continuous rather than categorical. Method: A multiwave longitudinal-epidemiologic twin study was conducted using 3,762 twins (1,808 male and 1,954 female) aged 11 to 29 years from the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research (MCTFR). The main outcome measures included various assessments of substance use, psychopathology, personality, and cognitive ability. Results: Although multiple trajectories are derived from growth mixture modeling techniques, these trajectories are arrayed in a tiered spectrum of severity, from lower levels of use to higher levels of use. Trajectories show perfect rank-order stability throughout development, monotonic increases in heritability, and perfect rank-order correlations with established correlates of alcohol use, including other substance use behaviors, psychiatric disorders, personality traits, intelligence, and achievement. Conclusion: Alcohol trajectories may represent continuous gradations rather than qualitatively distinct subgroups. If so, early detection and interventions for youth based on trajectory subtyping will be less useful than continuous liability assessments. Furthermore, a continuous account of development counters the notion that individuals are predestined to follow one of a few categorically distinct pathways and promotes the opposite idea that development is mutable, and its continuous terrain can be traversed in many directions.","2017-06","2018-12-21 16:26:02","2018-12-21 16:26:02","","498-505","","6","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol; development; early intervention; longitudinal; trajectories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this research with pigeons, we investigated the ephemeral choice task in which pigeons are given a choice between two alternatives, A and B, with similar reinforcement provided for each; however, if they choose A, they can also choose B, whereas if they choose B, A is removed. Thus, choosing A gives them two rewards, whereas choosing B gives them only one. Paradoxically, pigeons actually show a preference for B, the suboptimal alternative. We tested the hypothesis that pigeons made suboptimal choices because they were impulsive. To reduce impulsivity, we required the pigeons to make their initial choice 20 s before receiving the first reward. We found that requiring the pigeons to make a prior commitment encouraged them to choose optimally. The control group, for which the reward was provided immediately following initial choice, continued to choose suboptimally. The results confirm that requiring animals to make a prior commitment can facilitate the development of optimal choice. Furthermore, they may help explain why, without prior commitment, impulsive species, such as primates and pigeons have difficulty with this task, whereas presumably less impulsive species, such as wrasse fish and under some conditions parrots, are able to choose optimally even without prior commitment.","2017-06","2018-12-21 16:26:02","2018-12-21 16:26:02","","957-963","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Ephemeral choice task; Pigeons; Prior commitment; Suboptimal choice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary purpose of this study was to conduct the first prospective analysis of this relationship. MethodData from 1,147 families in an Australian population-based longitudinal study were used to examine: (1) temporal relationships between negative reactivity in early adolescence (13-14 years) and depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood (19-20 years); (2) the moderating role of parent-reported warmth in early adolescence (13-14 years); and (3) the moderating role of child gender. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to test the hypothesis that parental warmth would moderate the relationship between early adolescent negative reactivity and depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. ResultsAfter accounting for previous depressive symptoms at age 13-14 years, negative reactivity was positively associated with later depressive symptoms. By contrast, parental warmth at 13-14 years was negatively associated with later depressive symptoms for females but not males. Parental warmth did not moderate the association between early adolescent negative reactivity and subsequent depressive symptoms. ConclusionsThis study was the first to use prospective data to assess the protective effects of early adolescent parental warmth on the association between negative reactive temperaments and early adult depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that parental warmth for negatively reactive children provides only concurrent protection against subsequent depressive risk.

However, unlike memory research, previous attention research has not systematically examined the potential role of referential processing focus. The present study tested the hypothesis that evidence of depression-linked attentional avoidance of positive information would be more readily obtained following the self-referential processing of such information. We assessed attentional responding to positive information (and also to negative information) using a dot-probe procedure, after this information had been processed either in a self-referential or other referential manner. The findings lend support to the hypothesis under scrutiny. Participants scoring high in depression score exhibited reduced attention to positive information compared to those scoring low in depression score, but only when this information had been processed in a self-referential manner. These findings may shed light on the mechanisms that underpin attentional selectivity in depression, while potentially also helping to account for inconsistencies in previous literature.

However, little is known about how such expectancy violations affect subsequent cognition. Here we tested the hypothesis that violations of expectation enhance children's learning. In four experiments we compared 3-to 6-year-old children's ability to learn novel words in situations that defied versus accorded with their core knowledge of object behavior. In Experiments 1 and 2 we taught children novel words following one of two types of events. One event violated expectations about the spatiotemporal or featural properties of objects (e.g., an object appeared to magically change locations). The other event was almost identical, but did not violate expectations (e.g., an object was visibly moved from one location to another). In both experiments we found that children robustly learned when taught after the surprising event, but not following the expected event. In Experiment 3 we ruled out two alternative explanations for our results. Finally, in Experiment 4, we asked whether surprise affects children's learning in a targeted or a diffuse way. We found that surprise only enhanced children's learning about the entity that had behaved surprisingly, and not about unrelated objects. Together, these experiments show that core knowledge - and violations of expectations generated by core knowledge - shapes new learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to statistically significant main effects, structural equation modeling revealed the expected latent interaction effect. Response surface methodology demonstrated that students valued school more highly when their ability self-concepts were high in both domains rather than just one; a single low self-concept predisposed students to attach less value to school just as much as low self-concepts in both domains did. Helping all students frame attainable goals, thereby providing them with opportunities to experience success across domains, might increase the value they attach to school. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of nurses in 90 psychiatric inpatient wards in five hospital districts and one regional hospital in Finland. A total of 758 nurses (registered nurses or enrolled/mental health nurses) responded to the survey. Self-administered postal questionnaires were used to assess organizational justice, collaboration, nurses' stress, and violent assaults by patients. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used in model testing. Results: SEM did not support a role for stress in mediating between organizational justice, collaboration between nurses, and violent assaults by patients, given that stress levels were not dependent to a significant degree on organizational justice, nor were patients' assaults dependent on stress levels. However, low organizational justice and poor collaboration between nurses were associated with increased reports of violent assaults by patients in psychiatric inpatient settings (p <.05 for both). The model explained 5.7% of violent assaults at nearly significant levels (p=.052). Conclusions: These findings suggest that organizational justice, collaboration between staff members, and violent assaults by patients are linked in psychiatric inpatient settings. Evaluating a variety of factors, including issues related to organizational justice and collaboration among nurses, may be useful to minimize assaults by patients in psychiatric settings.","2017-05-01","2018-12-21 16:26:07","2018-12-21 16:26:07","","490-496","","5","68","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applying the electroencephalogram (EEG) operational synchrony analysis to extract three modules of the self-referential brain network in 12 medication-free depressive outpatients and 10 control subjects we have found an increase in the strength of EEG synchrony within all three modules in depressive patients (though non-significant for the right module). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis that used 3 factors (values of synchrony strength for all three modules) as input indicated that combined increase in the strength of synchrony in all three modules was positively associated with severity of depression. Taken together the findings of this study suggest that depression is primarily associated with hypersynchrony in all three modules of the brain self-referential network (the anterior module been responsible for “witnessing observation and first person perspective”, the left posterior module been responsible for “reflective agency and narration” and the right posterior module been responsible for “bodily representational-emotional agency”), thus contributing to excessive self-focus, rumination, and body tension.","2017-05","2018-12-21 16:26:07","2018-12-21 16:26:07","","30-36","","","99","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alpha rhythm; Depression; DMN; EEG; First-person perspective; Functional connectivity; Operational synchrony; Rumination; Self-referential brain network; Subjective sense of self","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on complementary approaches (attribute-based, metaphor-based, and target-based), 4 studies tested the hypothesis that older people are the targets of animalistic dehumanization. Using an emotional attribution task, Study 1 (N = 112) explored infrahumanization and shows that young participants attributed more uniquely human emotions to young people than to older ones. No such effect occurred with regards to nonuniquely human emotions. Results of Study 2 (N = 62) replicated this result using a lexical-decision task. Using the metaphor-based approach, Study 3 (N = 99) confirmed that older people's dehumanization is restricted to its animalistic form and does not extend to the mechanistic one. Finally, in Study 4 (N = 167), we used a target-based approach and showed that characteristics initially attributed to older people are perceived as denoting lesser humanness than when these same characteristics are associated with younger people.

The present study was the first to test the hypothesized mediation model connecting teacher behavior with peer liking and disliking status, via peer perceptions of teacher liking and disliking for the student. We used a longitudinal design and controlled for peer perceptions of student behavior. A sample of 1,420 5th-grade students (M-age = 10.60) from 56 classes completed sociometric questionnaires at 3 time points within 1 school year. At the first time point video data was also recorded, and teacher behavior toward specific students was coded. A multilevel path analysis showed that teachers did function as social referents for peer status but only through their negative behavior toward a student. Negative teacher behavior was associated with peer perceptions of the teacher's disliking for the student 3 months later, which in turn predicted peers' disliking of the student 6 months later. Findings suggest that teachers play a prominent role in peer relationships, particularly in peer disliking. For practice, this suggests that it may be important for teachers to refrain from openly negative behavior toward students, particularly those at risk of peer rejection.","2017-05","2018-12-21 16:26:09","2018-12-21 16:26:09","","546-558","","4","109","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","peer reputation of teacher (dis)liking; peer status; social referencing; teacher behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we tested the hypothesis that saccadic eye movements provide a natural bottleneck for the transition of fragile content in sensory memory to VSTM. In 4 experiments, we show that saccades, planned and executed after the disappearance of a memory array, markedly bias visual memory performance. First, items that had appeared at the saccade target were more readily remembered than items that had appeared elsewhere, even though the saccade was irrelevant to the memory task (Experiment 1). Second, this influence was strongest for saccades elicited right after the disappearance of the memory array and gradually declined over the course of a second (Experiment 2). Third, the saccade stabilized memory representations: The imposed bias persisted even several seconds after saccade execution (Experiment 3). Finally, the advantage for stimuli congruent with the saccade target occurred even when that stimulus was far less likely to be probed in the memory test than any other stimulus in the array, ruling out a strategic effort of observers to memorize information presented at the saccade target (Experiment 4). Together, these results make a strong case that saccades inadvertently determine the content of VSTM, and highlight the key role of actions for the fundamental building blocks of cognition.","2017-05","2018-12-21 16:26:10","2018-12-21 16:26:10","","736-748","","5","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","iconic memory; presaccadic attention; saccade; visual STM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we test the hypothesis that there is a direct causal effect of ADHD on educational achievement. The causal effect is tested in a genetically sensitive design to exclude the possibility of confounding by a third factor (e.g. genetic pleiotropy) and by comparing educational achievement and secondary school career in children with ADHD who take or do not take methylphenidate. Data on ADHD symptoms, educational achievement and methylphenidate usage were available in a primary school sample of similar to 10,000 12-year-old twins from the Netherlands Twin Register. A substantial group also had longitudinal data at ages 7-12 years. ADHD symptoms were cross-sectionally and longitudinally, associated with lower educational achievement at age 12. More ADHD symptoms predicted a lower-level future secondary school career at age 14-16. In both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, testing the direct causal effect of ADHD on educational achievement, while controlling for genetic and environmental factors, revealed an association between ADHD symptoms and educational achievement independent of genetic and environmental pleiotropy. These findings were confirmed in MZ twin intra-pair differences models, twins with more ADHD symptoms scored lower on educational achievement than their co-twins. Furthermore, children with ADHD medication, scored significantly higher on the educational achievement test than children with ADHD who did not use medication. Taken together, the results are consistent with a direct causal effect of ADHD on educational achievement.","2017-05","2018-12-21 16:26:11","2018-12-21 16:26:11","","278-289","","3","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ADHD; Causality; Educational achievement; Genetic pleiotropy; Methylphenidate; Twin study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that aggression would prospectively predict a shorter time to the onset of hypomanic/manic episodes and a longer time to the onset of major depressive episodes, based on the behavioral approach system theory of BSDs. Young adults (N=120) diagnosed with cyclothymia, bipolar II disorder, or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified were followed every 4 months for an average of 3.55 years. Participants completed measures of depressive and manic symptoms, family history of mood disorder, impulsivity, and aggression at baseline and were followed prospectively with semistructured diagnostic interview assessments of hypomanic/manic and major depressive episodes and treatment seeking for mood problems. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses indicated that overall, physical, and verbal aggression predicted a longer time to major depressive episode onset, even after controlling for baseline depressive and manic symptoms, family history of mood disorder, treatment seeking for mood problems, and impulsivity. Aggression, however, did not significantly predict time to onset of hypomanic/manic episodes, controlling for the same covariates.

However, the effects of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) on autonomic function in this population is unknown. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that SKY training improves CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling in patients with anxiety and/or depression disorders. Methods: Forty-six patients with a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression disorders (DSM-IV) were consecutively enrolled and divided in two groups: 1) conventional therapy (Control) and 2) conventional therapy associated with SKY (Treatment) for 15 days. Anxiety and depression levels were determined using quantitative questionnaires. For the assessment of CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling, cardiorespiratory traces were analyzed using monovariate and bivariate autoregressive spectral analysis, respectively. Results: After 15-days, we observed a reduction of anxiety and depression levels only in Treatment group. Moreover, sympathetic modulation and CAC were significantly lower while parasympathetic modulation and cardiorespiratory coupling were significantly higher in the Treatment compared to Control group. Conclusions: Intensive breathing training using SKY approach improves anxiety and/or depressive disorders as well as CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling. These finding suggest that the SKY training may be a useful non pharmacological intervention to improve symptoms and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with anxiety/ depression disorders.","2017-05","2018-12-21 16:26:12","2018-12-21 16:26:12","","74-80","","","214","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Affective disorders; Cardiac autonomic control; Cardiorespiratory coupling; Sudarshan Kriya Yoga","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within a motivated reasoning framework, we tested the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory Th2-associated cytokines, IL-10 and MDC, would be correlated with behavioral measures of social cognitive threat-detection bias (self-referential gaze detection bias and theory of mind (ToM) bias) in delusional versus non-delusional patients. We administered to schizophrenia patients with delusions (n=21), non-delusional patients (n=39) and controls (n=20) a social cognitive task designed to be sensitive to psychosocial stress response (the Waiting Room Task) and collected plasma levels of inflammatory markers using a bead-based flow immunoassay. Results partially supported our hypothesis. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was associated with self referential ToM bias in the delusional cohort as predicted, and not with non-delusional patients or healthy controls. This bias reflects a documented tendency of schizophrenia patients with delusions to excessively attribute hostile intentions to people in their environment. Since this cytokine correlated only with ToM bias and only in delusional patients, elevated levels of this cytokine in the blood may eventually serve as a useful biomarker distinguishing delusional patients from both non-delusional patients and healthy controls.","2017-05","2018-12-21 16:26:13","2018-12-21 16:26:13","","319-324","","","251","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bias; Cytokines; Delusions; IL-10; Kynurenine pathway; MDC/CCL22; Schizophrenia; Social cognition; Theory of mind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess this bias, we measured variations in pupillary dilation as a means of determining attentional arousal in response to neutral, negative and expectancy-violating versions of the same social stimuli: human faces. We conducted three baseline manipulation checks that directly compared neutral faces with threatening (angry) and expectancy-violating (upside-down and Thatcherized) faces, and three bias comparisons that directly compared threatening and expectancy-violating faces with one another. Across these experiments, we found evidence for a dominant expectancy bias in pupillary arousal for social stimuli, whereby expectancy-violating faces produced pupillary dilation earlier than neutral and threatening faces, with Thatcherized faces producing the greatest magnitude of dilation.

Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that opening psychiatric wards can reduce the number of aggressive assaults and of coercive treatment without increasing absconding rates. Methods Numbers of absconding, coercive medication, fixation and special security actions were collected retrospectively and compared between phases of closed (N total = 409; N legally committed = 64) and 90% of daytime opened (N total = 571; N legally committed = 99) doors in an acute psychiatric ward. Results During the phase of opened doors we observed significantly reduced aggressive assaults (p < 0,001) and coercive medication (p = 0,006) compared to the closed setting, while the absconding rate did not change (p = 0,20). Limitation Given the retrospective non-experimental design, no causal interpretations can be drawn. Conclusion The results suggest that open door is associated with reduction of aggressive assaults and coercive medication without increasing absconding rates. This speaks for a stronger implementation of open door policies in acute wards in order to preserve human rights in psychiatry. To collect more robust evidence for this thesis, longer phases should be monitored and moderating variables such as atmosphere and social cohesion should be assessed.","2017-04","2018-12-21 16:26:22","2018-12-21 16:26:22","","141-147","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","German","","","","","","","","","","","absconding behavior; acute wards; coercive treatment; human rights in psychiatry; open door policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It often results from the presence of a pleasant stimulus in the environment, whether that stimulus appears unpredictably or as a consequence of a particular behavior. The influence of positive affect linked to a random pleasant stimulus differs from the influence of positive affect resulting from performance-contingent pleasant stimuli. However, the mechanisms by which the performance contingency of pleasant stimuli modulates the influence of positive affect on cognitive control mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these differentiated effects are the consequence of the activation of the motivational “wanting” component specifically under performance contingency conditions. To that end, we directly compared the effects on cognitive control of pleasant stimuli (a monetary reward) attributed in a performance contingent manner, and of random pleasant stimuli (positive picture) not related to performance, during an AX-CPT task. Both proactive and reactive modes of control were increased specifically by performance contingency, as reflected by faster reaction times and larger amplitude of the CNV and P3a components. Our findings advance our understanding of the respective effects of affect and motivation, which is of special interest regarding alterations of emotion-motivation interaction found in several psychopathological disorders.

Theories of bilingualism suggests that exposure to two languages may yield a functional and neuroanatomical adaptation to support the learning of two languages (Klein et al., 2014). To test the hypothesis that this neural adaptation may vary as a function of structural and orthographic characteristics of bilinguals' two languages, we compared Spanish English and French-English bilingual children, and English monolingual children, using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy neuroimaging (fNIRS, ages 6-10, N =26). Spanish offers consistent sound-to-print correspondences (”phonologically transparent” or “shallow”); such correspondences are more opaque in French and even more opaque in English (which has both transparent and “phonologically opaque” or “deep” correspondences). Consistent with our hypothesis, both French- and Spanish-English bilinguals showed hyperactivation in left posterior temporal regions associated with direct sound-to-print phonological analyses and hypoactivation in left frontal regions associated with assembled phonology analyses. Spanish, but not French, bilinguals showed a similar effect when reading Irregular words. The findings inform theories of bilingual and cross-linguistic literacy acquisition by suggesting that structural characteristics of bilinguals' two languages and their orthographies have a significant impact on children's neuro-cognitive architecture for learning to read.","2017-04","2018-12-21 16:26:24","2018-12-21 16:26:24","","34-45","","SI","98","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bilingual reading acquisition; Bilingualism; Child literacy; Reading brain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In three experiments, Christian religious adherents were asked to evaluate a series of statements for which core intuitions about persons and acquired Christian beliefs about God were consistent (i.e., true according to both [e.g., God has beliefs that are true] or false according to both [e.g., All beliefs God has are false]) or inconsistent (i.e., true on intuition but false theologically [e.g., God has beliefs that are false] or false on intuition but true theologically [e.g., All beliefs God has are true]). Participants were less accurate and slower to respond to inconsistent versus consistent statements, suggesting that the core intuitions both coexisted alongside and interfered with the acquired beliefs (Experiments 1 and 2). In Experiment 2 when responding under time pressure participants were disproportionately more likely to make errors on inconsistent versus consistent statements than when responding with no time pressure, suggesting that the resolution of interference requires cognitive resources the functioning of which decreases under cognitive load.

Aims/hypothesesTo test the hypothesis that there is bias towards hospital disposal of female compared with male violent offenders with mental disorder. MethodsIn Sweden, the National Board of Forensic Medicine oversees all assessments of mental disorder for the criminal courts. Twenty-six Board appointed forensic psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers each independently assessed six case vignettes for fit with criteria for severe mental disorder', a prerequisite for hospital disposal from court. Each gender neutral vignette described a person who had been convicted of serious assault and had a major mental disorder. A gender was then assigned to each offender randomly within a block design, thus varying between sets. Participants were blind to the main aim of the study and the gender variation. ResultsThere was no significant association between gender of the person assessed and judgement that s/he had a severe mental disorder'. An offender depicted as having mental retardation was more likely to be assessed as at high risk of criminal recidivism if portrayed as female, regardless of the sex, place of work or level of experience of the assessor. ConclusionWe found no evidence of gender bias in determining appropriateness of a hospital disposal of an offender with mental disorder. The difference in assessment of recidivism according to sex of the patient was only in relation to mental retardation; further research would be needed to able to interpret this. As researchers in other countries have reported gender bias in disposals from court, our findings may provide support for a centralised forensic psychiatric assessment board and formal, on-going training.

The Self-Control Strength model, which proposes that self-control is dependent upon limited resources and susceptible to fatigue, may offer insight into relapse processes. The current study tested the hypothesis that self-control depletion (SCD), produced from engagement in emotional suppression, would serve as a novel antecedent for cessation failure, as indexed by a validated laboratory analogue of smoking lapse and relapse. We also examined whether SCD effects interacted with those of a well-established relapse precipitant (i.e., nicotine deprivation). Craving and behavioral economic indices (delay discounting and demand) were tested as hypothesized mechanisms for increased cessation failure. Ultimately, a moderated mediation model was used to test nicotine deprivation as a hypothesized moderator of SCD effects. Method: We used a 2 x 2 (12-hr deprivation vs. no deprivation; SCD vs. no SCD) factorial between-subjects design (N = 128 smokers). Results: The primary hypothesis of the study was supported, as SCD increased lapse behavior (p = .04). Nicotine deprivation significantly increased craving, cigarette demand, delay discounting, and lapse behavior. No main effects were found for SCD on putative mediators (i.e., craving, demand, and discounting), but the SCD and deprivation manipulations interacted upon craving (p = .04). The moderated mediation model was significant. SCD was found to increase craving among nicotine deprived smokers, which mediated effects on lapse behavior. Conclusions: SCD appears to play an important role in smoking relapse and may be a viable target for intervention.","2017-04","2018-12-21 16:26:28","2018-12-21 16:26:28","","381-396","","4","85","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","behavioral economics; relapse; self-control; smoking; withdrawal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighty-three male offenders on community license, 65% of whom met the threshold for antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), completed a battery of computerized mentalizing tests requiring perspective taking (Perspectives Taking Test), mental state recognition from facial expression (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test), and identification of mental states in the context of social interaction (Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition). The results were compared with a partially matched sample of 42 nonoffending controls. The offender group showed impaired mentalizing on all of the tasks when compared with the control group for this study when controlling for demographic and clinical variables, and the offending group performed poorly in comparisons with participants in published studies, suggesting that limited capacity to mentalize may be part of the picture presented by individuals with histories of offending behavior. Offenders with ASPD demonstrated greater difficulty with mentalizing than non-ASPD offenders. Mentalization subscales were able to predict offender status and those with ASPD, indicating that specific impairments in perspective taking, social cognition, and social sensitivity, as well as tendencies toward hypomentalizing and nonmentalizing, are more marked in individuals who meet criteria for a diagnosis of ASPD. Awareness of these deficits may be helpful to professionals working with offenders, and specifically addressing these deficits may be a productive aspect of therapy for this “hard to reach” clinical group.","2017-04","2018-12-21 16:26:30","2018-12-21 16:26:30","","232-255","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results and Conclusion: Results show that identity and behavioral enculturation in one's heritage culture are predictors of bonding with parents, which is notably protective for youth. The results highlight the critical effect of enculturation in enhancing youth perception of the parent-child relationship. Behavioral acculturation to mainstream culture, in contrast, predicts youth problems, although the effect may not necessarily always be via family processes.

Results: Conscientiousness and openness predicted subsequent increases in physical activity, whereas agreeableness predicted subsequent decreases in physical activity. Physical activity was associated with increases in openness (and conscientiousness for women) at Time 1-Time 2, but was unrelated to change in personality between Time 2-Time 3. In addition, there was some evidence that temporal associations between personality and physical activity were moderated by participant age.

For this purpose, participants in our experiments learned cue-outcome relationships that followed the opposites rule: Single cues that signaled the same outcome (e.g., A-1/B-1) predicted the opposite outcome when presented in compound (e.g., AB-2). Some cues were only presented in compound during training (e.g., EF-1) to see if at test participants tended to generalize according to rule-based (i.e., E-2/F-2) or according to feature-based generalization ( i.e.,E-1/F-1). The generalization test used 2 different tasks: a predictive judgment task, and a cued-response priming task. In Experiment 1, participants' verbal ratings were consistent with rule-based generalization. However, participants' reaction times (RTs) in the cued-response priming task were consistent with feature-based generalization. Experiment 2 replicated the results from Experiment 1, and it also provided evidence consistent with feature-based or rule-based generalization depending on whether a short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA; 200 ms) or a long SOA (1300 ms), respectively, was used in the priming task. Our results are interpreted as supporting the idea that feature-based generalization process relies on fast, associative processes, whereas rule-based generalization is slow and depends on executive control resources. The latter generalization process would inhibit the former when enough time and resources are available. Otherwise, feature-based generalization would take control of responses.","2017-04","2018-12-21 16:26:35","2018-12-21 16:26:35","","515-527","","4","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","feature-based; generalization; judgments; priming; rule-based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, opposing features of eye widening versus eye narrowing that regulate sensitivity versus discrimination not only conveyed their associated basic emotions (e.g.,fear vs. disgust, respectively) but also conveyed opposing clusters of complex mental states that communicate sensitivity versus discrimination (e.g.,awe vs. suspicion). This sensitivity-discrimination dimension accounted for the majority of variance in perceived mental states (61.7%). Further, these eye features remained diagnostic of these complex mental states even in the context of competing information from the lower face.

The present research tested the hypothesis that threats to masculinity would lead men to behave in ways that express toughness to a greater extent if they were highly masculine, as measured by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory. Further, we anticipated that self-affirmation would ameliorate the compensatory responding exhibited by higher masculine men under threat. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental cells in a 2 (Masculine Identity Threat: yes, no) x 2 (Self-Affirmation: yes, no) between-subjects factorial design. Results indicated that men expressed masculine toughness to a greater extent when facing a masculinity threat than when under no threat. Further, higher masculinity amplified the effect of threat in expressing toughness. Results also showed that the opportunity to self-affirm reduced expression of toughness among higher masculine men facing a masculinity threat. Theoretical contributions, implications, and future directions for this line of research are discussed.","2017-04","2018-12-21 16:26:38","2018-12-21 16:26:38","","176-186","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","defensive processing; masculine compensation; masculinity; self-affirmation; self-concept","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have suggested that ikigai impacts on mortality. However, its impact upon disability is unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between ikigai and incident functional disability among elderly persons. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 830 Japanese elderly persons aged >= 70 years as a comprehensive geriatric assessment in 2003. Information on ikigai was collected by self-reported questionnaire. Data on functional disability were retrieved from the public Long-term Care Insurance database in which participants were followed up for 12 years. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cls) for incidence of functional disability were calculated for three groups delineated according to the presence of ikigai (”no”, “uncertain” or “yes”) using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: The 12-year incidence of functional disability was 533% (442 cases). As compared with the “no” group, the multiple-adjusted HR (95% CI) of incident functional disability was 0.61 (0.36-1.02) for the “uncertain” group and 0.50 (030-0.84) for the “yes” group.

Inspired by the job demands-resources model, this study explores whether having a strong commitment to the nursing profession can be seen as a resource that buffers the effect of job demands on emotional exhaustion or, conversely, intensifies the impact of job demands. A survey that comprised Norwegian nurses who had graduated three years previously (N = 388) was conducted. Multiple regression was performed to test the hypothesis. The results provide support to a buffering effect; thus, individuals with a higher degree of professional commitment conveyed a weaker association between job demands and emotional exhaustion compared with nurses with a lower degree of commitment. Developing a better understanding of the potential buffering effect of professional commitment is of great interest.

From corpus based co occurrence statistics as a measure of association strength we computed individual neighborhoods for single neutral words comprised of the 10 words with the largest association strength. We then selected neutral words according to the valence of the associated words included in the neighborhoods, which were either mostly positive, mostly negative, mostly neutral or mixed positive and negative, and tested them using a valence decision task (VDT). The data showed that the valence of semantic neighbors can predict valence judgments to neutral words. However, all but the positive neighborhood items revealed a high tendency to elicit negative responses. For the positive and negative neighborhood categories responses congruent with the neighborhood's valence were faster than incongruent responses. We interpret this effect as a semantic network process that supports the evaluation of neutral words by assessing the valence of the associative semantic neighborhood. In this perspective, valence is considered a semantic super-feature, at least partially represented in associative activation patterns of semantic networks.","2017-03-13","2018-12-21 16:26:41","2018-12-21 16:26:41","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ambivalence; co-occurrence networks; neutral words; semantic processing; valence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is little consensus over how this cognitive feat might be accomplished. We tested the hypotheses that an efficient, but inflexible, mindreading system gives rise to appropriate reaction time facilitation in a standard unexpected transfer task, but not in a task involving an identity component. We created a new behavioural paradigm where adults had to quickly select whether an actor would teach, or not reach, for an object based on the actor's false belief about the object's location. By manipulating the type of object we compared participants' responding behaviour when they did and did not have to take the actor's perspective into account. While the overall accuracy reflected a high level of flexible belief reasoning across both tasks, the pattern of response times across conditions revealed a limit in the processing scope of an efficient mindreading system. Thus, we show, for the first time, that there are indeed different profiles of reaction times for object-location scenarios and for object-identity scenarios. The results elevate growing evidence that adult humans have not one, but two mindreading systems for dealing with mental states that underlie action. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Two studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that the emotion of social pain following rejection promotes the development of social anxiety in subsequent situations. In Study 1, undergraduate participants were exposed to 2 social situations (Cyberball) 2 days apart. Participants who were rejected in the first situation reported higher social anxiety before and during the second situation relative to those who were included. This effect was fully mediated by initial social pain intensity. In Study 2, all participants were initially rejected. Using double-blinded drug administration, participants were randomly assigned to ingest acetaminophen to alleviate the social pain from rejection, or a sugar placebo. As predicted, the acetaminophen group reported lower social anxiety before and during the second situation. Approximately half of the effect was mediated by reduction in social pain. Notably, the immediate effect of acetaminophen was specific to social pain rather than social anxiety.

The acquisition of this ability is not fully understood, and it remains an area in which artificial systems have yet to surpass people. We sought to investigate the memory process that supports object recognition. Specifically, we investigated the association of inputs that co-occur over short periods of time. We tested the hypothesis that human perception exploits expectations about object kinematics to limit the scope of association to inputs that are likely to have the same token as a source. In several experiments we exposed participants to images of objects, and we then tested recognition sensitivity. Using motion, we manipulated whether successive encounters with an image took place through kinematics that implied the same or a different token as the source of those encounters. Images were injected with noise, or shown at varying orientations, and we included 2 manipulations of motion kinematics. Across all experiments, memory performance was better for images that had been previously encountered with kinematics that implied a single token. A model-based analysis similarly showed greater memory strength when images were shown via kinematics that implied a single token. These results suggest that constraints from physics are built into the mechanisms that support memory about objects. Such constraints-often characterized as `Core Knowledge'-are known to support perception and cognition broadly, even in young infants. But they have never been considered as a mechanism for memory with respect to recognition.","2017-03","2018-12-21 16:26:44","2018-12-21 16:26:44","","362-375","","3","146","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Core Knowledge; long-term memory; object recognition; spatiotemporal continuity; tolerance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants (69 men, 50 women; aged 19-76) in AUD outpatient programs completed 2 baseline laboratory assessments, then provided daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports of state affect and alcohol use for 28 days. SAT indices of chronic self-regulatory stress were obtained in the laboratory with the Social Competence Interview (SCI) and the Anger Transcendence Challenge (ATC). Chronic regulatory stress was indexed by blood pressure responses to both tasks. Emotion regulation capabilities were indexed by anger regulation behavior observed during ATC, and by self-ratings of recent positive social interactions and goal thoughts. DMR indices of trait and state affect were obtained with the General Psychiatric Distress scale of the Brief Symptom Inventory, the trait anger scale of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, and intensive EMA ratings of state affect (anger, sadness, fear, happiness, stress) during each day. The outcomes were: (a) not drinking on a given day, and (b) number of drinks consumed when drinking. Statistical models accounting for problems of zero inflation in drinking data and missing data evaluated the hypothesis that “ tonic” (cumulative) and phasic (situational) processes specified by the SAT and DMR models together shape drinking in a given moment. No drinking was reported on 91% of days; reports were missing on 7.2% of days. Both drinking outcomes were predicted by SAT indices of SCI self-directive stress, ATC anger regulation, positive goal cognitions and social interactions, and by DMR indices of general distress and state affect (sad, angry, stressed). Unexpected and potentially informative associations emerged also. The findings were robust under models that accounted for different missing data assumptions. Findings suggest that SAT and DMR models and methods may advance scientific understanding of drinking risk during outpatient AUD treatment.","2017-03","2018-12-21 16:26:45","2018-12-21 16:26:45","","238-263","","3","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol use disorder; Dynamic Model of Relapse; Social Action Theory; state affect; stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arsenic levels were negatively associated with corresponding suicide rates, consistently among both men and women in all three study-decades, whereas mortality from natural causes increased with arsenic levels. Contrary to an hypothesized greater risk of suicide with higher concentrations of arsenic, we found a negative association, suggesting a possible protective effect, whereas mortality from natural causes was increased, in accord with known toxic effects of arsenic.

According to some treatment protocols it is counterproductive, whereas according to other protocols it is seen as a quite useful strategy. The main purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that distraction is adaptive when combined with active acceptance, but maladaptive when combined with avoidant strategies. A non-clinical community sample of adults (N = 638) and a clinical sample (N = 172) completed measures of emotion regulation and well-being. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify subgroups with different profiles on six emotion regulation variables, and these subgroups were then compared on well-being (positive and negative emotionality, and life quality) and on clinical status. A nine-cluster solution was chosen on the basis of explained variance and homogeneity coefficients. Two of these clusters had almost identical scores on distraction, but showed otherwise very different profiles (distraction combined with acceptance vs. distraction combined with avoidance). The distraction-acceptance cluster scored significantly higher than the distraction-avoidance cluster on all measures of well-being; it was also under-represented in the clinical sample, whereas the distraction-avoidance cluster was over-represented. Limitations include a cross-sectional design, and use of self-report measures. The findings suggest that distraction may be either adaptive or maladaptive, depending on whether it is combined with an attitude of acceptance or avoidance.","2017-03","2018-12-21 16:26:47","2018-12-21 16:26:47","","117-127","","1","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Acceptance; Avoidance; Cluster analysis; Cognitive restructuring; Distraction; Emotion regulation; Negative emotionality; Positive emotionality; Quality of life","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, prolonged use is associated with diminished psychosocial outcomes, potentially mediated by drug-induced cognitive impairments. (9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, yet other phytocannabinoids in the plant, such as cannabidiol (CBD), have unique properties. Given that CBD can modulate the undesirable effects of THC, therapeutic agents, such as nabiximols, contain higher CBD:THC ratios than illicit marijuana. We tested the hypothesis that THC impairs a relevant cognitive function for long-term success, namely willingness to exert cognitive effort for greater rewards, and that CBD could attenuate such decision-making impairments. Methods Male Long-Evans rats (n = 29) performing the rat cognitive effort task (rCET) received acute THC and CBD, independently and concurrently, in addition to other cannabinoids. Rats chose between 2 options differing in reward magnitude, but also in the cognitive effort (attentional load) required to obtain them. Results We found that THC decreased choice of hard trials without impairing the animals' ability to accurately complete them. Strikingly, this impairment was correlated with CB1 receptor density in the medial prefrontal cortex an area previously implicated in effortful decision-making. In contrast, CBD did not affect choice. Coadministration of 1:1 CBD:THC matching that in nabiximols modestly attenuated the deleterious effects of THC in slacker rats. Limitations Only male rats were investigated, and the THC/CBD coadministration experiment was carried out in a subset of individuals. Conclusion These findings confirm that THC, but not CBD, selectively impairs decision-making involving cognitive effort costs. However, coadministration of CBD only partially ameliorates such THC-induced dysfunction.","2017-03","2018-12-21 16:26:51","2018-12-21 16:26:51","","131-138","","2","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many studies have found threat bias indices to have poor reliability and have failed to observe the theorized relationship between threat bias and anxiety symptoms; this may be due to the non-unitary nature of threat bias and the influence of state-level variables on its expression. Accumulating data suggests that state anxious mood is important for the robust expression of threat bias and for relations to emerge between threat bias and symptoms, though this possibility has not been experimentally tested. Eye-tracking was used to assess multiple forms of threat bias (i.e., early vigilance, sustained attention, facilitated engagement, delayed disengagement) thought to be related to anxiety. A non-clinical sample (N = 165) was recruited to test the hypothesis that biased attention towards threat, but not dysphoric or positive emotional stimuli, during an anxious mood induction, but not at a pre-stress baseline, would prospectively predict greater worry symptoms on days in which more naturalistic stressors occurred. Results revealed the hypothesized moderation effect for sustained attention towards threat after the mood induction but not at baseline, though sustained attention towards dysphoric stimuli also moderated the effect of stressors on worry. Worry-relevant sustained attention towards negative emotional stimuli may be a partially mood-context dependent phenomenon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In Experiment 1, relative to the active control group, participants who practiced self-control were more hesitant to engage in mock violence (e.g., “cutting” the experimenter's throat with a rubber knife), especially for participants high in dispositional empathy. In Experiment 2, practicing self-control increased obedience to kill insects, but only among participants Who felt little moral responsibility for their actions. There was a trend for decreased killing among participants who felt morally responsible for their actions. Our findings suggest that When asked to behave aggressively, self-control promotes adherence to personal values, which may or may not fuel aggression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

According to cognitive dissonance theory, consumer orientations toward the benefits attributed to organic products (environmental protection, health, hedonic) relieve the dissonance that results from this attitude-behavior incongruity. Knowledge also functions as a transmitter, from positive attitudes to purchase behaviors, thereby reducing the incongruity. Using quota sampling in a survey study, this paper tests the hypotheses from linear regression models. The results show that orientations and knowledge improve the congruity between attitudes and purchase behaviors toward organic products. Moreover, interaction effects arise between the environmental protection orientation and knowledge and between the hedonic orientation and knowledge. Increasing knowledge mitigates the difference between attitudes and purchase behaviors, especially for consumers with environmental protection or hedonic orientations. These findings have several important implications for research and practice.","2017-02-24","2018-12-21 17:48:39","2018-12-21 17:48:39","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive dissonance theory; environmental protection orientation; health orientation; hedonic orientation; organic market knowledge; organic products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of this intermediate phenotype holds promise for understanding SZ pathophysiology, identifying SZ treatment targets and developing animal models. DNA methylation (DNAm), the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide, regulates gene transcription and is a strong candidate for such a mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that DNAm correlates with DSD in the human STG and that this relationship is disrupted in SZ. We used the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 Beadchip Array to quantify DNAm on a genome-wide scale in the postmortem STG from 22 SZ subjects and matched non-psychiatric control (NPC) subjects; DSD measures were available for 17 of the 22 subject pairs. We found DNAm to correlate with DSD at more sites than expected by chance in NPC, but not SZ, subjects. In addition, we show that the slopes of the linear DNAm-DSD correlations differed between SZ and NPC subjects at more sites than expected by chance. From these data, we identified 2 candidate genes for mediating DSD abnormalities in SZ: brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2 (BAIAP2) and discs large, Drosophila, homolog of, 1 (DLG1). Together, these data suggest that altered DNAm in SZ may be a mechanism for SZ-related DSD reductions.","2017-02-14","2018-12-21 17:48:39","2018-12-21 17:48:39","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only When Switching Away From an Effortfully Established Task Set","EMOTION","","1528-3542","10.1037/emo0000212","","The current study investigated whether trait anxiety was systematically related to task-set shifting performance, using a task-switching paradigm in which 1 task was more attentionally demanding than the other. Specifically, taking advantage of a well-established phenomenon known as asymmetric switch costs, we tested the hypothesis that the association between trait anxiety and task-set shifting is most clearly observed when individuals must switch away from a more attentionally demanding task for which it was necessary to effortfully establish an appropriate task set. Ninety-one young adults completed an asymmetric switching task and trait-level mood questionnaires. Results indicated that higher levels of trait anxiety were systematically associated with greater asymmetry in reaction time (RT) switch costs. Specifically, the RT costs for switching from the more attentionally demanding task to the less demanding task were significantly greater with higher levels of trait anxiety, whereas the RT costs for switching in the opposite direction were not significantly associated with trait anxiety levels. Further analyses indicated that these associations were not attributable to comorbid dysphoria or worry. These results suggest that levels of trait anxiety may not be related to general set-shifting ability per se, but, rather, that anxiety-specific effects may primarily be restricted to when one must efficiently switch away from (or let go of) an effortfully established task set.","2017-02","2018-12-21 17:48:39","2018-12-21 17:48:39","","88-101","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attentional control theory; executive functions; task switching; trait anxiety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: A sample of 165 family caregivers of individuals with dementia (IWD) completed an 8-day diary study. Caregivers provided 5 saliva samples across the 8 days. On some days, caregivers provided all or most of the care. On other days, their relative attended ADS for part of the day. A 3-level unconditional linear spline model was fit to describe the typical sAA diurnal rhythms. Predictors were then added to the unconditional model to test the hypotheses on ADS use and daily stressors. Results: Daily ADS use did not have an effect on diurnal sAA regulation. However, controlling for daily ADS use, greater ADS use over the 8 days was associated with a more prominent rise between 30 min after wake-up and before lunch, and a more prominent decline between before lunch and late afternoon. Fewer ADS days were associated with a more flattened sAA diurnal rhythm. Additionally, greater daily care-related stressor exposures had a within-person association with lower sAA levels in the late afternoon. Care-related stressor exposures had significant within-and between-person associations with sAA diurnal slopes. Furthermore, daily positive experiences had a significant between-person association with sAA diurnal slopes. Conclusions: Caring for a disabled family member may heighten the vulnerability to potential physiological conditions. Respite from care stressors from ADS use may have some biobehavioral benefits on sAA regulations.","2017-02","2018-12-21 17:48:40","2018-12-21 17:48:40","","160-168","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adult day services; daily stressors; family caregivers; salivary alpha-amylase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aim: Based on the tripartite model of emotions (TME), this study tested the hypothesis that higher tendencies to experience negative affect and physiological hyperarousal would predict higher levels of test anxiety, while the experience of positive affect would not influence test anxiety. The present study also explored whether the broadly defined dimensions of the tripartite model are useful fot predicting educational outcomes. Sample: One hundred and eighty-eight secondary school students (aged 16-19) were recruited in a prospective design study. Method: Participants completed self-reported measures of the variables of interest. Structural equation modelling was employed to examine the relationships among these variables, and evaluate whether these relationships are consistent with the TME. Results: The findings were partly consistent with the TME, in particular, negative affect contributed to greater levels of test-specific worries, such as the personal and social consequences of failing. Such worries, in turn, directly impaired test performance, while the influence of negative affect on test performance was mediated by test anxiety. Conclusions: The general construct of negative emotions appeared to be too broad for its influence to be detected, while more specific constructs such as the factors of test anxiety were useful predictors of test performance. The facilitative role of test anxiety was also identified, insofar as emotional apprehension or tension in the absence of intrusive cognitive worries had a positive influence on test performance.

MethodsBreast cancer survivors (n=552) participating in an observational study of cancer outcomes responded to an open-ended question about the cause of their cancer. Of these, 245 women had sought treatment from complementary and alternative integrative oncology (IO) clinics, and 307 women did not. ResultsWomen frequently described theories for their cancer's cause including genetics and family history (31%), stress and coping (31%), toxins and chemicals (27%), a variety of lifestyle and epidemiological risk factors, and randomness (17%). Self-reported beliefs about cancer's cause differed among women in association with their use of IO. IO users were somewhat more likely to describe stress and poor coping as causes of their cancer and less likely to describe random chance as a cause of cancer (p<0.05).

The precise mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Prior studies have found that arousal of negative emotion exaggerates the severity of these communication disturbances; this has been coined “affective reactivity”. Recent research suggests that “cognitive reactivity” may also occur, namely reflecting reduced “on-line” cognitive resources in SMI. We tested the hypothesis that communication disturbances manifest as a function of limited cognitive resources in SMI above and beyond that associated with state affectivity. We also investigated individual differences in symptoms, cognitive ability, and trait affect that may be related to cognitive reactivity. We compared individuals with SMI (n=52) to nonpsychiatric controls (n=27) on a behavioral-based coding of communication disturbances during separate baseline and experimentally-manipulated high cognitive-load dual tasks. Controlling for state affective reactivity, a significant interaction was observed such that communication disturbances decreased in the SMI group under high cognitive-load. Furthermore, a reduction in communication disturbances was related to lower trait and state positive affectivity in the SMI group. Contrary to our expectations, limited cognitive resources temporarily relieved language dysfunction. Implications, particularly with respect to interventions, are discussed.","2017-02","2018-12-21 17:48:42","2018-12-21 17:48:42","","98-104","","","248","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Affect; Cognition; Communication disturbances; Language; Serious mental illness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the generalized hypervigilance hypothesis (GHH), FM patients show excessive attention towards pain stimuli and other sensory events, thereby increasing pain perception and dysfunctional behaviour. We tested this notion by assessing interoceptive accuracy (IA) in FM patients and matched healthy controls. We also tested the hypothesis that FM is characterized by reduced self-regulatory capacity as indexed by heart rate variability (HRV). Methods: 47 FM patients (M-age = 45.5,39 females) and 45 healthy controls (M-age, = 44.9,37 females) completed several self-report scales (Body Vigilance Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, Pain Catastrophizing Scale). To derive HRV, heart rate was monitored under resting conditions: for the assessment of IA participants performed a heartbeat tracking task in which they were asked to silently count their heartbeats. Results: FM patients reported higher body vigilance than healthy controls, but there were no group differences in IA. FM patients had lower HRV compared with healthy controls. HRV did not predictor IA. Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings do not support the hypothesis of generalized hypervigilance in FM patients. Patients reported a heightened focus on bodily sensations, which was not reflected in IA. It may be that hypervigilance is not a general and stable characteristic but is rather context dependent and modality-specific. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Less is known about the relationship between asthma and the Latino cultural idiom of distress of ataques de nervios, as well as the role that psychosocial stressors play. The current study tested the hypotheses that Latino asthma patients who experience PD, ataques de nervios, and/or asthma-related death of a loved one endorse greater psychological triggers of asthma, greater perceived impact of asthma triggers, and greater difficulty controlling such triggers than do those without these conditions. Methods: Data originated from an interview conducted prior to a randomized controlled trial in which 292 Latino adults with self-reported asthma were recruited from outpatient clinics in the Bronx, NY. The PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) was used to screen for PD symptoms, while the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I) was used to confirm diagnosis of PD. Lifetime history of ataques de nervios and asthma-related death of a loved one were based upon self-report. Asthma triggers were examined using the Asthma Trigger Inventory (ATI). Results: PD, ataques de nervios, and asthma-related death of a loved one each predicted a higher frequency of psychological asthma triggers, controlling for gender and comorbid medical conditions. Participants with PD also reported greater impact of asthma triggers than those without PD, while no significant differences in perceived control were observed.

Caregivers completed narrowband measures of SCT and ADHD symptoms and broadband measures of internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Results: A significant, positive relation was found between TSH concentration and SCT symptoms, but not between TSH and ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, regression analyses indicated that the association between TSH and SCT remained significant after controlling for child demographic characteristics, broadband measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and ADHD symptoms. However, effects were small in magnitude. Conclusion: Although preliminary, results indicate that thyroid functioning may be related to SCT. Given the small effects, however, it is important for future research to examine other endocrine and biological correlates that may inform models of the developmental psychopathology of SCT.","2017-02","2018-12-21 17:48:44","2018-12-21 17:48:44","","240-246","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ADHD; attention-deficit; children; endocrinology; hyperactivity disorder; sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT); thyroid functioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Associations between childhood trauma, as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), anxious and avoidant attachment in romantic relationships, as measured by the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R), and five personality domains, as measured by the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118), were examined in a sample of 72 psychiatric inpatients. The SIPP-118 domains included relational capacities, identity integration, self-control, responsibility, and social concordance. The direct effect of childhood trauma on all SIPP-118 domains was not significant after controlling for the indirect effect of attachment. In regression modeling, a significant indirect effect of childhood trauma via adult attachment style was found for SIPP-118 relational capacities, identity integration, self-control, and social concordance. Specifically, anxious attachment was a significant mediator of the effect of childhood trauma on self-control, identity integration, and relational domains. These results suggest that childhood trauma impacts a broad range of personality domains and does so in large part through the pathway of anxious romantic attachment style.","2017-02","2018-12-21 17:48:44","2018-12-21 17:48:44","","58-75","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Abuse; attachment; child abuse; personality disorders; personality measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, perceived importance of agentic versus communal traits for success in science may contribute to subtle gender biases in science. Perceptions of science faculty may be especially important to investigate due to their positions as role models, exemplars, and gatekeepers. The present study tested the hypothesis that agentic traits are considered more important for success in science than communal traits, Faculty (n = 115) and undergraduate students (n = 122) from science departments at large, research-intensive universities were surveyed using either an open- or closed-ended format, so as to gauge what traits come to mind as well as those possibly related to success in science. Both faculty and students, regardless of gender, perceived agentic traits as more important for success in science than communal traits. Additionally, there were no gender differences in self-perceptions of agentic traits, though women perceived themselves as more communal than men. Finally, participants' perceptions of their own traits correlated with those they perceived as necessary for success in science. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to investigate associations between early medical events and ASD, as well as autistic traits, in twins, to test the hypothesis of a cumulative environmental effect on ASD risk. A total of 80 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (including a rare sample of 13 twin pairs discordant for clinical ASD) and 46 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs with varying autistic traits, were examined for intra-pair differences in early medical events (for example, obstetric and neonatal factors, first year infections). First, differences in early medical events were investigated using multisource medical records in pairs qualitatively discordant for ASD. The significant intra-pair differences identified were then tested in relation to autistic traits in the remaining sample of 100 pairs, applying generalized estimating equations analyses. Significant association of the intra-pair differences in the MZ pairs were found for the cumulative load of early medical events and clinical ASD (Z = -2.85, P = 0.004) and autistic traits (beta = 78.18, P = 0.002), as well as infant dysregulation (feeding, sleeping abnormalities, excessive crying and worriedness), when controlling for intelligence quotient and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder comorbidity. The cumulative load of early medical events in general, and infant dysregulation in particular, may index children at risk of ASD owing to non-shared environmental contributions.

An experimental study with new and long-term patients","BMC PSYCHIATRY","","1471-244X","10.1186/s12888-016-1182-1","","Background: Patients seeking treatment may be assumed to prefer a psychiatrist who suggests a new treatment with confidence and optimism. Yet, this might not apply uniformly to all patients. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that new patients prefer psychiatrists who present treatments optimistically, whilst patients with longer-term experience of mental health care may rather prefer more cautious psychiatrists. Methods: In an experimental study, we produced video-clips of four psychiatrists, each suggesting a pharmacological and a psychological treatment once with optimism and once with caution. 100 `new' patients with less than 3 months experience of mental health care and 100 `long-term' patients with more than one year of experience were shown a random selection of one video-clip from each psychiatrist, always including an optimistic and a cautious suggestion of each treatment. Patients rated their preferences for psychiatrists on Likert type scales. Differences in subgroups with different age (18-40 vs. 41-65 years), gender, school leaving age (<= 16 vs. > 16 years), and diagnosis (ICD 10 F2 vs. others) were explored. Results: New patients preferred more optimistic treatment suggestions, whilst there was no preference among long-term patients. The interaction effect between preference for treatment presentations and experience of patients was significant (interaction p-value = 0.003). Findings in subgroups were similar. Conclusion: In line with the hypothesis, psychiatrists should suggest treatments with optimism to patients with little experience of mental health care. However, this rule does not apply to longer-term patients, who may have experienced treatment failures in the past.","2017-01-17","2018-12-21 17:48:45","2018-12-21 17:48:45","","","","","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Communication; Information; Pharmacotherapy; Psychiatric treatment; Psychological treatment; Treatment expectations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TARA contains training of autonomic and emotional self-regulation, interoceptive awareness, relational skills, and value-based committed action. Methods: We performed a single-arm trial to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of TARA in reducing depression and anxiety levels and assessed whether the specific targeted domains of function reflected the hypothesized symptom change. Twenty-six adolescents (14-18 years old, 7 males and 1(females) participated in the 12-week group program. Assessment was performed before (T0), immediately after (T1), and 3 months after the end of TARA (T2). Results: Significant improvement was seen in depression symptoms (Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale Second Edition) between T0-T1 (t-value = -3.56, p = 0.002, CI = -6.64, -1.77) and T0-T2 (t-value = -4.17, p < 0.001, CI = -11.20, -3.75) and anxiety symptoms (Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children) between T0-T1 (t-value = -2.26, p = 0.033, CI = -4.61, -0.21) and T0-T2 (t-value = -3.06, p = 0.006, 95% confidence interval = -9.02, -1.73). Significant improvements in psychological flexibility, sleep, and mindfulness skills were also found between T0 and T2. Limitations: The sample size was small without a control condition. The pilot design did not allow for testing the hypothesized brain changes and effect of TARA on relevant systemic biomarkers. Conclusion: TARA is feasible in a sample of clinically depressed and/or anxious adolescents and preliminary efficacy was demonstrated by reduced depression and anxiety symptoms.

We test the hypothesis that depressed participants who engage in greater (rather than lower) concurrent use of experiential avoidance strategies will demonstrate impaired positive (PA) and negative (NA) emotional reactivity when pleasant events take place. Methods: 50 Veterans with a range of depression severity completed a 7-day phone-based ecological momentary assessment protocol that assessed the pleasantness of their recent activity, level of PA and NA, and concurrent use of experiential avoidance strategies. \textbackslash Results: As events were rated as more pleasant, depressed Veterans using less experiential avoidance were distinguished from depressed Veterans using greater experiential avoidance, such that greater experiential avoidance interfered with PA and NA reactivity. Limitations: Small sample of primarily older men, all were Veterans, and assessments relied on self-reports of event pleasantness and depression; we did not include a control group. Conclusions: It is critical to understand how depressed individuals experience potentially rewarding aspects of their environments. Our study provides preliminary data that depressed individuals may benefit from positive events in daily life when experiential avoidance is low and may demonstrate impaired reactivity when avoidance is high. This study may help clinicians to identify the contexts that support hedonic responses to potentially rewarding aspects of their depressed patients' environments.","2017-01-15","2018-12-21 17:48:46","2018-12-21 17:48:46","","414-417","","","208","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anhedonia; Depression; Ecological momentary assessment; Emotional reactivity; Experiential avoidance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fill this gap, this study tested the hypothesis that perceived low parental care would be associated with negative core beliefs, which, in turn, would be associated with dysfunctional attitudes. To strictly test the hypothesis, this study controlled for current depressive symptoms that could affect the relationships between study variables. The participants were 305 college students (141 females). The results differed by sex: for female students, the hypothesis was supported; for male students, negative core beliefs were associated with dysfunctional attitudes; however, perceived low care was not associated with negative core beliefs. The findings suggest that targeting low parental care and negative core beliefs for females and negative core beliefs for males may help prevent their dysfunctional attitudes and the resultant depression.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:47","2018-12-21 17:48:47","","739-751","","8","151","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Dysfunctional attitudes; negative core beliefs; parenting; sex differences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, depression as a consequence of an immune disorder has received increased research attention. Here, we test the hypothesis that the depression-immunity association is a buffer zone between external stimuli, defence mechanisms, and intrinsic determinants. Subjects and methods: Five hundred and forty-nine patients presenting with a major depressive episode completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Lazarus and Folkman's coping inventory, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale (FACES III). Lymphocyte subtypes were quantified using flow cytometry. Results: Links between immunity and depression were confirmed: levels of CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells accounted for 12.7% of the variance in the BDI (p<0.001, linear regression; LR). The depression-immunity pairing interacted with family dynamics, coping mechanisms, and gender. Dynamics in the family of origin explained 11.4% of the BDI score (LR) and 1% of CD3 and CD4 levels (p<0.001, Pearson's r). Coping mechanisms were associated with 12% of the BDI score (p<0.001, LR), and the capacity of distancing oneself from one's problems was associated with 10.3% of CD3, CD8, and CD16/ 56 levels (p<0.01, LR). BDI scores in women were 2.9 points higher than in men (p<0.01, t=2.379) and associated with a greater risk of immune depression (p<0.001, odds ratio=0.5). Conclusions: External determinants (family), coping mechanisms, and internal determinants (such as gender) simultaneously influence a depression-immunity pairing. Sometimes these factors act more on the mood component, sometimes more on the immune component. The two components also interact closely with each other.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:47","2018-12-21 17:48:47","","S274-S278","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","depression; immunity; psychosomatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to the 4-week CSIS procedure, which involves unpredictable rotation between phases of isolation and overcrowding. Behavioral analyses (Experiment 1) were performed on the same rats before and after CSIS (n=16) and physiological and biochemical measurements (Experiment 2) were made on further control (CON; n=7) and stressed groups (CSIS; n=8). Behaviors in the open field test (locomotor and exploratory activities) and elevated-plus maze (anxiety-related behaviors) indicated anxiety after CSIS. CSIS did not alter the physiological parameters measured, i.e. body weight gain, regularity of estrous cycles, and circulating concentrations of stress hormones and sex steroids. QRT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed on amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hypothalamus. The main finding is that CSIS alters the mRNA levels for the studied genes in a region-specific manner. Hence, expression of POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin), AVPR1a (arginine vasopressin receptor), and OXTR (oxytocin receptor) significantly increased in the amygdala following CSIS, while in PFC and/or hypothalamus, POMC, AVPR1a, AVPR1b, OXTR, and ER (estrogen receptor beta) expression decreased. CSIS significantly reduced expression of CRH-R1 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1) in the hippocampus. The directions of change in gene expression and the genes and regions affected indicate a molecular basis for the behavior changes. In conclusion, CSIS may be valuable for further analyzing the neurobiology of stress-related disorders in females.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:47","2018-12-21 17:48:47","","549-561","","6","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anxiety behavior; chronic social stress; females; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; limbic brain; relative gene (mRNA) expression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the conditions in which one is most likely to resist stigma have not been identified, and models of stigma resistance have yet to incorporate one's ability to consider the mind of others. The present study investigated the impact of the interaction between metacognition, or one's ability to form an integrated representation of oneself, others, and the world, and fear of negative evaluation on one's ability to resist stigma. Methods: Narratives of encounters with stigma shared by 41 persons with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders were first coded for spontaneous expressions of fear of negative evaluation from others. Two-step cluster analyses were then conducted in order to test the hypothesis that metacognition and fearing negative evaluation from others are important, interacting pathways which contribute to resisting stigma. Results: Those with high (n = 11; 26.8%), intermediate (n = 9; 22.0%), and low metacognition (n = 21; 51.2%) significantly differed on stigma resistance (F = 9.49, p < .001) and the high metacognition group was most likely to resist stigma. Those with high and low metacognition did not express fear of negative evaluation, while those with intermediate metacognition did express fear of negative evaluation. Conclusions: Findings suggest that metacognition and fear of negative evaluation are important, interacting pathways influencing how individuals process and respond to stigma. Results offer preliminary support for this novel model of stigma resistance and support the use of metacognitive therapies for facilitating stigma resistance.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:49","2018-12-21 17:48:49","","50-55","","1","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors expected that promotion focus relates positively to performance and negatively to sickness absence, while prevention focus relates positively to exhaustion and sickness absence, both for managers and non-managers. Furthermore, the authors expected that promotion focus relates positively to performance but also to exhaustion and sickness absence when prevention focus is high, only for managers (i.e. a manager's dual regulatory focus can be an effective but also exhausting leadership strategy). Design/methodology/approach - The authors tested the hypotheses via moderated regression analyses among two independent groups, managers (n = 241) and non-managers (n = 415). Findings - Promotion focus was positively related to managers' and non-managers' performance and negatively to non-managers' sickness absence, while prevention focus did not have any main effects. As expected, managers' promotion focus was positively related to managers' sickness absence when managers' prevention focus was high (i.e. dual regulatory focus). Furthermore, managers' promotion focus negatively related to managers' performance when managers' prevention was high, failing to support the hypothesis. Practical implications - Promotion focus should be enhanced by organizations among leaders and employees. The authors also cautiously discuss the possibility of interventions comparing a promotion focus with dual-focus training.

Descriptive frequencies and percentages were used to identify the determinants of ESBs. Findings - The results suggest that employees' perception of their own safety behaviour was positive. OC was reported to have a strong positive impact on ESBs. Safe working conditions, job satisfaction and organisational leadership were identified as the key organisational determinants of safety behaviours among the employees. Research limitations/implications - Interpreting these findings must be done with caution as the sample size was relatively small and solely obtained from four beverage manufacturing firms. Generalising the findings from this study must also be carefully done as the study is industry-specific and country-specific. Practical implications - Besides the loss of talents through unsafe behaviours, accidents can hurt work performance, productivity and profitability of an organisation. Industry organisations and their managers can therefore implement perceptual, organisational and cultural interventions that reinforce appropriate safety behaviours among employees at the workplace. Social implications - Understanding these cultural, perceptual and organisational perspectives on ESBs is not only a significant input for safety behavioural analysis and interventions but can also reduce the socioeconomic cost of unsafe and risk behaviours among employees at the firm, industry, national and global levels. Originality/value - The empirical tests of employees' perception of their own safety behaviours are heavily biased towards data originating from the developed country industry settings which suggest that the dynamics of ESBs in the less developed economies are likely to be unknown. This study is first to examine ESBs in a developing country beverage manufacturing industry setting.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:50","2018-12-21 17:48:50","","1915-1930","","8","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Beverage manufacturing industry; Employees' safety behaviours; Ghana; Organizational culture; Other determinants of employees' safety behaviours; Perception of employees' safety behaviours","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), two supervisory motivating styles were examined: the autonomy-supportive style, characterized by nurturing employees' inner motivational resources, and the controlling style, in which supervisors pressure their employees to behave in specific manager-directed ways. Legitimacy was defined according to the Relational Model of Authority (RMA). Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was administered to a sample of 252 employees. Moderation and mediation analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings - The autonomy-supportive motivating style, but not the controlling style, was linked to employee work-related outcomes (i.e. job satisfaction, commitment, engagement, burnout, and depression) through perceived legitimacy. Legitimacy buffered the negative impact of the controlled orientation on burnout and depression. Originality/value - Taken together, the results suggest that legitimacy as a resource may be enhanced by autonomy support and can also minimize the harmful consequences of controlling supervisory behaviors. The theoretical implications of integrating SDT with RMA and the practical implications of these findings are discussed.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:50","2018-12-21 17:48:50","","561-580","","8","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Legitimacy; Motivation; Self-determination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ear temperatures were taken in 2 sessions, 2times for each ear at each session. Average left ear temperature was subtracted from average right ear temperature as an index of dominant temperature. Only 56 of the participants showed a stable dominant ear temperature. For these 56 participants, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between scores on the Hemispheric Consensus Prediction Profile and tympanic member temperature (Spearman's =.29, 95% CI [.04,.51]). Individuals with a left hemispheric cognitive style tended to have a warmer left tympanic membrane temperature while those with a right hemispheric cognitive style tended to have a warmer right tympanic membrane temperature. Tympanic membrane temperatures are easily obtained using inexpensive and noninvasive technology.

Data were used from the population-based Vasterbotten Environmental Health Study (n=3406). The participants consisted of 164 individuals with allergic asthma and 298 individuals with allergic rhinitis as well as 2876 individuals without allergic or non-allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis.

Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated from binary logistic regression analysis, both crude and adjusted for age and education. The adjusted ORs (1.87-4.00) for all FSSs differed significantly from unity for both allergic asthma and rhinitis. The results provide support for the hypothesis of comorbidity in allergic asthma and rhinitis with FSSs. Since central sensitisation is likely to underlie FSSs, the present findings raises the question as to whether central sensitisation may also be involved in allergic asthma and rhinitis.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:52","2018-12-21 17:48:52","","1163-1168","","10","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Fibromyalgia; irritable bowel syndrome; medically unexplained symptoms; migraine; population-based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, their job performance ensures an organization's innovative capability. Focusing on the process nature of creativity and innovation in organizations, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of R&D personnel's active knowledge sharing on their job performance and highlight the significance of social skills by examining their moderation effect. Design/methodology/approach - This study conducted a survey of 252 R&D personnel in 60 R&D organizations in large South Korean firms. Data reliability and validity were confirmed, and regression analysis was performed to test the hypotheses. Findings - The authors found that R&D personnel's knowledge sharing has a significant effect on their job performance. Furthermore, social skills significantly moderate the relationship between knowledge sharing and job performance. Originality/value - This study addresses the existing literature's limited understanding of the process nature of creativity and innovation by examining knowledge sharing as a personal engagement in the innovation process, which has a positive effect on job performance. The study also casts new light on the importance of social skills in fortifying personal engagement in the innovation process. The overall results will prove valuable in the selection of effective R&D personnel and the design of competency development programs for R&D organizations.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:52","2018-12-21 17:48:52","","387-400","","5","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Job performance; Knowledge sharing; Social skill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were randomly assigned to either a power priming condition or a control condition and then completed measures assessing their attitudes, future intentions, and willingness to sacrifice for environmental conservation. Consistent with our hypothesis, the psychological experience of power decreased people's environmental attitudes and willingness to sacrifice for the environment, but only when these responses were made privately. These findings suggest that a sense of power, when experienced in private, influences the way individuals feel about and intend to engage in pro-environmental sacrifice. The findings also suggest that this effect may be eliminated when judgments are made transparently, in public view.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:54","2018-12-21 17:48:54","","169-186","","3","144","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","leadership; motivation; natural environment; Power; transparency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of intergenerational contact in shaping hiring decisions. Drawing from the intergroup contact theory, the authors investigated affective and cognitive categorization reactions as predictors of decision-makers' willingness to hire older people and whether these relationships are moderated by intergenerational contact frequency and quality. Design/methodology/approach - The authors tested the hypotheses using data from 232 employees with hiring power. Findings - Results indicate that intergroup anxiety was negatively related to decision-makers' willingness to hire older people. Further, intergenerational contact frequency exacerbated the relationship between intergroup anxiety and willingness to hire older people; whereas intergenerational contact quality buffered the negative relationship. In addition, the authors found that intergenerational contact quality facilitated the positive relationship between perceived outgroup competence and willingness to hire older people.

It is also of interest in this study to investigate if E.S. college students would have lower mental health literacy and thus, more social distance attitudes toward schizophrenia, than would U.S. students. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used. The predicted variable was country of membership: El Salvador and the U.S. The predictors were recognition, knowledge, social distance, help-seeking attitudes, and negative attribution toward schizophrenic patients. The participants (N = 340) were students from a university in E.S. and in California. Through a survey, participants were asked to diagnose a person described in a case vignette. Knowledge of schizophrenia and social distance attitudes were measured. Principal component analyses using oblimin rotation were conducted to build composite factors from the observed variables. The discriminant function accurately predicted 74.4% of the participants' country of membership, chi(2)(1) = 75.23, p < 0.001. At the individual level, 69.9% of individuals from the U.S. and 77.5% of individuals from E.S. were correctly classified. Furthermore, results indicated that U. S. students recognized schizophrenia at a higher rate, compared to E.S. students. In the E.S. group, social distance attitudes differed with level of MHL. These findings are troublesome in that social distance attitudes inhibit help-seeking behavior. Education programs aimed at promoting mental health awareness among the E.S. population are indicated.","2017-03","2018-12-21 17:48:55","2018-12-21 17:48:55","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","mental health literacy; schizophrenia; stigma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 68 adults with hypertension and overweight/obesity, and stepwise multiple regression analysis and mediation analyses were carried out to test the hypothesis that eating styles mediate the relationship between negative emotional symptoms and cholesterol. Several significant correlations among age, anthropometric, medical, and psychological variables (eating styles and negative emotional symptoms) were found. There was a significant indirect effect of anxiety on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol through emotional eating. Results suggest that emotional eating has a relevant role in the rise in total and LDL cholesterol, acting as a mediator in the relationship between anxiety and cholesterol. This finding could have important implications, since it introduces a new variable in the relationship between emotions and cholesterol and, therefore, changes the way of understanding this relationship, and of treating high cholesterol in a hypertensive sample.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:55","2018-12-21 17:48:55","","911-918","","8","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anxiety; Cholesterol; emotional eating; hypertension; obesity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The participants were asked to rate the degree to which they desired a romantic relationship with each female using an 8-point scale. The participants rated attractive females higher than unattractive females, and this effect was associated with ventral striatum activation. The participants also indicated lower ratings for females with a partner than for females without a partner, and this effect was associated with parietal cortex activation. As predicted, the participants characterized by higher orbitofrontal activity demonstrated a greater willingness to engage in a romantic relationship with females who have a partner compared with females who do not have a partner.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted two cross-sectional studies to test the hypotheses. In Study 1, data were obtained from students (n = 90), whereas in Study 2, the authors used an executive sample (n = 83). Findings - The primary motivation of benign envy was to bring oneself up by improving performance on the comparison dimension, whereas the primary motive of malicious envy was to pull the envied other down. The relationship between malicious envy and behavioral “pulling down” intentions of derogating envied other was conditional on perceived opportunity on the comparison dimension. Consistent with a motive to improve self-evaluation, this study also found that perceived opportunity to perform interacted with benign envy to promote performance intentions on an alternative dimension. Furthermore, malicious envy was also associated with self-improving performance intentions on the comparison dimension, conditional upon perceived opportunity to perform. Practical implications - Envy, depending on its nature, can become a positive or negative force in organizational life. The pattern of effects for opportunity structure differs from previous findings on control. The negative and positive effects of malicious envy may be managed by attention to opportunity structures. Originality/value - This study supports the proposition that benign envy and malicious envy are linguistically and conceptually distinct phenomena, and it is the first to do so in a sample from Pakistan, a non-western and relatively more collectivistic culture.

S.","Perception of music by listeners of different ethnic cultures","VOPROSY PSIKHOLOGII","","0042-8841","","","The article focuses on differentiated perception of music, namely identifying emotional content of music by representatives of different ethnic cultures. The aim of the study was to find typical patterns of individual differences in perception of music. The methodology was based on the idea of synergy of both individual and cultural experience of the recipient during perception of music. The authors tested the hypothesis that between Russian and Chinese students there are differences in perception of “native” and “alien” music as far as its emotional content. There is a contradiction that needs to be resolved. On the one hand, perception is based on generalized musical language standards that are specific to a particular culture, and in this case “native” music should be more easily recognized than “alien”; on the other hand, understanding of music as a language of feelings and moods is not based on cultural experience but on a universal emotional ability; in this case, there should be no differences in perception of the emotional content of music by representatives of different ethnic and cultural groups. The study is based on the idea of connection between perception of “ethno-style” music and recipients' “ethno-hearing”. The ethno-style variable was represented by four musical samples: Slavic and Chinese instrumental melodies, classical violin music (N. Paganini) and music of the twentieth century (D. Shostakovich). The study participants assessed the fragments they had listened to on twelve bipolar psychometric scales, reflecting emotional and dynamic characteristics of the music. The phenomenon of “ethno-hearing” was studied by means of classifying the results of evaluations of emotional sound features into groups the Chinese and the Russian. A total of 53 people participated: 27 Russian music students (M = 24,7) and 26 Chinese music students from Moscow university (M = 25,6).

Twenty-one parents received the intervention, consisting of eight 1.5-hour sessions. The study tested the hypothesis that the intervention led to an improvement in parenting variables and a decrease in children's behavior problems, assessed by a multimethod procedure. The results partially confirmed the prediction, as they showed an enhancement of parents' responsiveness and parent self-efficacy belief, which are promising findings, but no modifications of negative practices. These effects persisted for 4 months after the intervention. Moreover, a decrease in children's externalizing behavior problems was reported by parents in a questionnaire, but this was not confirmed by an observational paradigm. This last result seems to show that a parent-implemented verbal responsive intervention is necessary for some children with externalizing behavior difficulties but often insufficient, and has to be part of a multidisciplinary treatment approach.","2017","2018-12-21 17:48:59","2018-12-21 17:48:59","","108-130","","2","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Externalizing behavior problems; parent-implemented verbal responsive intervention; parenting; preschoolers; responsiveness; self-efficacy belief","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The windows are generated by a segmentation process, implemented by a cascade of oscillators. This paper tests the hypothesis that prosodic segmentation is driven by a flexible (in contrast to autonomous, rigid) oscillator in the delta range (0.5-3 Hz) by tracking prosodic rhythms, such that intelligibility is impaired when the ability of this oscillator to synchronise to these rhythms is impaired. In setting phrasal boundaries, both bottom-up acoustic-driven and top-down context-invoked processes interact in a manner that is difficult to decompose. The present experiments used context-free random-digit strings in order to focus exclusively on bottom-up processes. Two experiments are reported. Listeners performed a target identification task, listening to stimuli with prescribed chunking patterns (Experiment I) or chunking rates (Experiment II), followed by a target. Irrespective of the chunking pattern, performance is high only for targets inside of a chunk, pointing to the benefit of acoustic prosodic segmentation in digit retrieval. Importantly, performance remains high as long as the chunking rate is within the frequency range of neuronal delta, but sharply deteriorates for higher rates. This data provides psychophysical evidence for the role of acoustic-driven segmentation, with flexible delta oscillations at the core, in digit retrieval.","2017","2018-12-21 17:49:00","2018-12-21 17:49:00","","545-561","","5, SI","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","chunking; delta rhythms; Prosodic segmentation; synchronisation; word retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has yet to examine if this can be a consequence of a stereotypical consistency between social and information attributes of diversity. The present study tests the hypothesis that, in a team with a stereotype-based faultline (a stereotypical consistency between gender and skills), there is increased out-group derogation compared to a team with a stereotype-inconsistent faultline. Furthermore, the study proposes that tasks can activate stereotypes, and the need for cognition dictates whether stereotypes are applied. The findings confirm the hypothesis and additionally provide evidence that tasks that activate gender stereotypes emphasize out-group derogation, especially for team members with low need for cognition.","2017","2018-12-21 17:49:00","2018-12-21 17:49:00","","352-365","","3","157","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Need for cognition; stereotype consistency; stereotype-based faultline; task stereotypicality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that worse performance on an FAR task would be associated with reduced QoL (related to social and emotional functioning), worse mood, and increased fatigue. Forty-seven individuals with TBI and 27 healthy controls (HCs) completed the facial emotion identification task (FEIT), as well as questionnaires assessing social and emotional QoL, mood, and fatigue. The TBI group performed significantly worse than HCs on the FEIT. A significant relationship between FAR and fatigue and QoL related to social and emotional functioning was documented, but in an unexpected direction: individuals who performed better on the FEIT reported poorer QoL and greater fatigue.

Nonetheless, overconfidence in our ability to recognize faces has carried over into various aspects of our legal system; for instance, eyewitness identification serves a critical role in criminal proceedings. For this reason, understanding the perceptual and psychological processes that underlie false identification is of the utmost importance. Gaze direction is a salient social signal and direct eye contact, in particular, is thought to capture attention. Here, we tested the hypothesis that differences in gaze direction may influence difficult decisions in a lineup context. In a series of experiments, we show that when a group of faces differed in their gaze direction, the faces that were making eye contact with the participants were more likely to be misidentified. Interestingly, this bias disappeared when the faces are presented with their eyes closed. These findings open a critical conversation between social neuroscience and forensic psychology, and imply that direct eye contact may ( wrongly) increase the perceived familiarity of a face.","2017-02","2018-12-21 17:49:01","2018-12-21 17:49:01","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","applied visual science; eye gaze direction; eyewitness identification; face perception; legal procedures; misidentification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research shows that people feel sadness in response to losses but it's unclear whether sad expressions function to communicate losses to others and if so, what makes these signals credible. Here we use economic games to test the hypothesis that sad expressions lend credibility to claims of loss. Participants play the role of either a proposer or recipient in a game with a fictional backstory and real monetary payoffs. The proposers view a (fictional) video of the recipient's character displaying either a neutral or sad expression paired with a claim of loss. The proposer then decided how much money to give to the recipient. In three experiments, we test alternative theories by using situations in which the recipient's losses were uncertain (Experiment 1), the recipient's losses were certain (Experiment 2), or the recipient claims failed gains rather than losses (Experiment 3). Overall, we find that participants gave more money to recipients who displayed sad expressions compared to neutral expressions, but only under conditions of uncertain loss. This finding supports the hypothesis that sad expressions function to increase the credibility of claims of loss.","2017-03","2018-12-21 17:49:02","2018-12-21 17:49:02","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","emotion; facial expression; game theory; sad; signaling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also evaluates the moderating role of job insecurity on the relationships between perceived employability and the two employee outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected via a random sampling survey on living conditions of Hong Kong citizens in 2014. The final sample consists of 414 Chinese working adults. The authors employ structural equation modeling and moderated regression analysis to test the hypotheses. Findings - Results show that volition and self-efficacy are positively related to perceived employability, and perceived employability in turn positively relates to work engagement and job satisfaction. Besides, perceived employability fully mediates the effect of volition and partially mediates the effect of self-efficacy, on the two outcome variables. The authors also find that job insecurity acts as a significant moderator on the relationships between perceived employability and the outcomes.

A second-stage mediated moderation model explains how a manager's personality influences the content and fulfillment of PCs in different organizational contexts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data from 749 managers at Australian organizations were collected and regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. The Edwards and Lambert (2007) approach was used to analyze conditional indirect effects. Findings - Managers high on agreeableness, conscientiousness and extraversion are more likely to establish relational PCs with their staff than managers low on these personality traits. The effects of agreeableness and conscientiousness on the fulfillment of the PC occur through the “relational PC” variable. Once a relational PC is established, a manager's ability to fulfill the PC is constrained by the extent to which polices and practices are formalized. Research limitations/implications - Organizations may need to delegate more power and discretion to managers to enable them to fulfill employer obligations toward their staff, and/or clearly communicate to managers their boundaries in employment promises. In turn, managers need to be aware of personality's influence on the creation and fulfillment of promises. Causality cannot be inferred because of the study's cross-sectional data. Originality/value - Research has focused on employees' personality and perceptions of the PC. This study is the first to focus on managers' personality and PC creation and fulfillment.","2017","2018-12-21 17:49:04","2018-12-21 17:49:04","","136-153","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Line managers; Mediated-moderated analysis; Organizational structure; Personality traits; Psychological contract; Quantitative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attention is an essential component of this construct: People often report feeling that they have focused attention into a narrative world, and disengaged attention from the physical environment. The goal of our research was to test if people's attention is captured in a dynamic fashion over the course of narrative experiences. To achieve this goal, we used excerpts from narrative films. One way in which filmmakers command viewers' attention is by generating suspense, which arises when viewers confront potential negative outcomes. In our experiments, we tested the hypothesis that hot spots, moments at which potential negative outcomes are emphasized, will narrow the viewer's attentional focus compared to cold spots, moments that do not emphasize negative outcomes. We measured attentional tuning through latencies in reaction time to audio probes as participants viewed suspenseful film excerpts. We also administered post-viewing recognition memory tests for still images taken from hot and cold spots. Across three experiments, participants missed more probes and exhibited slower reaction times during suspenseful hot spots than cold spots. These findings provide evidence for changes in attentional tuning as people view film narratives.","2017","2018-12-21 17:49:06","2018-12-21 17:49:06","","60-89","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: Participants were 220 domestic violence survivors recruited consecutively from 12 shelters for women in Turkey (response rate 70%). They were assessed with the Semi-Structured Interview for Survivors of Domestic Violence, Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist, Depression Rating Scale, and Fear and Sense of Control Scale. Results: Survivors were exposed to 21 (SD = 6.7) physical, psychological, and sexual violence stressors over 11.3 (SD = 8.8) years. They reported high levels of peritrauma perceived distress of and lack of control over stressor events. Approximately 10 months after trauma, many feared reliving the same domestic violence events, felt helpless, feared for their life, and felt in danger. PTSD and depression rates were 48.2% and 32.7%, respectively. The strongest predictors of PTSD and depression were fear due to a sense of ongoing threat to safety and sense of helplessness in life, which explained the largest amount of variances in these psychiatric conditions. Conclusion: The findings support the contemporary learning theory of traumatic stress and are consistent with findings of studies involving earthquake, war, and torture survivors.

Three experiments tested the hypothesis that prejudice causes threat perception, using affective conditioning to create new prejudice toward unfamiliar groups. The experimentally created prejudice increased threat perception (Experiments 1-3), except when threat information was inconsistent with conditioned affect (Experiment 3). Consistency of affect and threat information is necessary in order for threat to be a plausible justification of prejudice. Mere prejudice can cause perception of threat in the absence of information about the group; this finding suggests threats are not necessarily inherent to the characteristics of the group.

Some of those who witnessed the Biafran War (also known as Nigerian Civil War) as children are well into late adulthood, while the majority of this pre-war/wartime cohort who are in their golden years will enter into later life in less than a decade from now. The aim of the present research was to examine the role of stressful life events and family support in successful ageing of the BWG.Method: Data were collected using a self-administered survey completed by 453 members of the BWG who were 45 years. The survey included measures such as the Successful Ageing Inventory, Life Events Inventory, and family support subscale of Family Dynamics Scale. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses of the study.Results: The three dimensions of stressful life events (health events, interpersonal events and work-related/financial events) had moderate negative relationships with successful ageing. Family support was moderately and positively associated with successful ageing. For the moderation hypotheses, family support was a significant moderator of only the relationship between work-related stressful life events and successful ageing, especially for the <65 years subgroup.Conclusion: Growing old can be a very positive experience for both the individual and the society.

Selective attention chooses which objects to represent in short-term memory (STM) on the basis of their relevance. Because STM is limited in capacity, one must sometimes choose which objects are removed from memory in light of new relevant information. We tested the hypothesis that the choices among newly presented information and old information in STM involve the same process-that both are acts of selective attention. We tested this hypothesis using a two-display partial-report procedure. In this procedure, subjects had to select and retain relevant letters (targets) from two sequentially presented displays. If selection in perception and retention in STM are the same process, then irrelevant letters (distractors) in the second display, which demanded attention because of their similarity to the targets, should have decreased target report from the first display. This effect was not obtained in any of four experiments. Thus, choosing objects to keep in STM is not the same process as choosing new objects to bring into STM.","2017-01","2018-12-21 17:49:10","2018-12-21 17:49:10","","117-137","","1","79","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention: Interactions with memory; Selective attention; Short-term memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present caregiver outcomes. 88 primary care providers (PCPs) in seven geographically underserved communities referred 223 children (ages 5.5 - 12.9 years) to the randomized controlled trial. Over 22 weeks, children randomized to the CATTS service delivery model received six sessions of telepsychiatry and six sessions of caregiver behavior management training provided in person by community therapists who were trained and supervised remotely. Children randomized to the comparison Augmented Primary Care (APC) service model received management in primary care augmented by a single telepsychiatry consultation. Caregiver outcomes included changes in distress, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and Family Empowerment Scale (FES). Caregivers completed five assessments. Multilevel mixed effects regression modeling tested for differences between the two service delivery models in caregiver outcomes from baseline to 25 weeks. Compared to caregivers of children in the APC model, caregivers of children in the CATTS service model showed statistically significantly greater improvements on the PHQ-9 (beta = -1.41, 95 % CI = [-2.74, -0.08], p < .05), PSI (beta = -4.59, 95 % CI = [-7.87, - 1.31], p < .001), CSQ (beta = -5.41, 95 % CI = [- 8.58, -2.24], p < .001) and FES (beta = 6.69, 95 % CI = [2.32, 11.06], p < .01). Improvement in child ADHD symptoms mediated improved caregiver scores on the PSI and CSQ. Improvement in child ODD behaviors mediated caregiver CSQ scores. The CATTS trial supports the effectiveness of a hybrid telehealth service delivery model for reducing distress in caregivers of children with ADHD and suggests a mechanism through which the service model affected caregiver distress.","2017-01","2018-12-21 17:49:11","2018-12-21 17:49:11","","27-43","","1","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ADHD; Caregiver training; E-health; Mediation by improvement in child ADHD symptoms; Primary outcome of reduction in caregiver distress; Randomized controlled trial; Service delivery model; Telehealth; Telemental health; Telepsychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Across species, acute pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system has provided evidence of its critical role in fear extinction, but the effects of chronic cannabis on extinction are relatively understudied. In rats, chronic cannabinoid administration impairs fear extinction in a drug-free state. Here we examine whether chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans. Participants were healthy chronic cannabis users (n = 20) and nonuser controls with minimal lifetime cannabis use (n = 20) matched on age, sex, and race who all screened negative for psychiatric disorders. A 2-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use would be associated with impaired extinction of the skin conductance response. Consistent with hypotheses, chronic cannabis use was associated with reduced within-session extinction of skin conductance response on Day 1 (d = 0.78), and between-session extinction on Day 2 (d = 0.76). Unexpectedly, cannabis use was also associated with reduced subjective differentiation between threat and safety stimuli during conditioning. Replication and translation of findings are necessary to test potential mechanisms directly and examine whether impairments can be reversed pharmacologically or after a period of cannabis abstinence. General Scientific Summary Fear extinction provides a laboratory model to examine abnormal responses to stress. This study suggests that adults who regularly use marijuana have less capacity to extinguish previously conditioned fear responses compared to nonusing adults.","2017-01","2018-12-21 17:49:11","2018-12-21 17:49:11","","117-124","","1","126","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cannabinoids; comorbidity; exposure therapy; fear conditioning; marijuana","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose that these relationships unfold via a relational process and specified this relational process in terms of leader-member exchange. Moreover, we assume that these relationships depend on followers' personal need for structure. We tested the hypothesized moderated-mediation model in a two-wave survey study with 142 employees. Our results support the proposed model. We found the predicted indirect effect of humor on commitment and disengagement to be stronger for followers low in need for structure.

This study leveraged intensive longitudinal data (N = 959; 49.6 % females) to test the hypothesis that internalizing symptoms in childhood may be driven more strongly by family experiences whereas internalizing symptoms in adolescence may derive more uniquely from familial loading for affective disorders (i.e., maternal depression). We evaluated the relative contributions of (a) family experiences (b) maternal depression, and (c) peer influences in testing this hypothesis. The results indicated that family predictors were more strongly correlated with childhood (relative to adolescent) internalizing symptoms. In contrast to previous findings, maternal depression also exhibited stronger associations with childhood internalizing symptoms. Although often overlooked in theories concerning potential differential origins of childhood vs. adolescent internalizing symptomatology, peer experiences explained unique variation in both childhood and adolescent internalizing problems.","2017-01","2018-12-21 17:49:12","2018-12-21 17:49:12","","197-212","","1, SI","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Environment; Internalizing symptomatology; Peer victimization; Psychopathology; Puberty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Less is known, however, about the mechanisms by which goal priming affects food choice. This experiment tested the hypothesis that goal priming affects food choices through changes in visual attention. Specifically, it was hypothesized that priming with the dieting goal steers attention toward goal-relevant, low energy food products, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of choosing these products. Methods: In this eye-tracking experiment, 125 participants chose between high and low energy food products in a realistic online supermarket task while their eye movements were recorded with an eye-tracker. One group was primed with a health and dieting goal, a second group was exposed to a control prime, and a third group was exposed to no prime at all. Results: The health goal prime increased low energy food choices and decreased high energy food choices. Furthermore, the health goal prime resulted in proportionally longer total dwell times on low energy food products, and this effect mediated the goal priming effect on choices. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the effect of priming on consumer choice may originate from an increase in attention for prime-congruent items. This study supports the effectiveness of health goal priming interventions in promoting healthy eating and opens up directions for research on other behavioral interventions that steer attention toward healthy foods.","2017-01","2018-12-21 17:49:14","2018-12-21 17:49:14","","82-90","","1","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","dietary restraint; food choice; goal priming; visual attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On this task, pigeons appear to time the occurrence of the reversal rather than using feedback from previous trials, resulting in increased numbers of errors. In the present experiments, we tested the hypothesis that pigeons make so many errors because they fail to remember the last response made and/or the consequence of making that response both of which are needed ideally as cues to respond on the next trial. To facilitate memory, during the 5-s intertrial interval, we differentially lit a houselight correlated with the prior response to S1 or S2 and maintained the hopper light when that response was correct. A control group received uncorrelated houselights and no maintained hopper light. To test for continued use of temporal information, both groups received probe sessions in which the intertrial interval was either halved or doubled. Providing relevant reminder cues of the stimulus chosen and its consequence resulted in improved reversal accuracy and reduced disruption from probe sessions compared with irrelevant cues. Nevertheless, despite the reminder cues, the pigeons in both groups appeared to continue to time the point in the session at which the reversal occurred.","2017-01","2018-12-21 17:49:14","2018-12-21 17:49:14","","62-71","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","behavioral flexibility; memory; pigeons; timing; win-stay/lose-shift","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both factors likely influence health outcomes via hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation. However, it is unclear how early experience and HPA axis activity influence adult social status. We studied differentially reared female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, N=90) as models to test the hypothesis that chronic HPA axis activity assessed via hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) mediated the relationship between early life experience and adult social rank. We found that mother-peer-reared (MPR) monkeys acquired higher social ranks than either of the two nursery-reared (NR) groups (peer-reared, PR, or surrogate-peer-reared, SPR monkeys) (=-0.07, t((89))=-2.16, p=0.034). We also found that MPR HCCs were lower during the juvenile period at 18months (F-(2,F-25)=3.49, p=0.047). Furthermore, for MPR but not NR monkeys, changes in HCCs from 18 to 24months (r((s))=-0.627, p=0.039) and adult HCCs (r((s))=-0.321, p=0.03) were negatively correlated with adult social rank. These findings suggest that chronic HPA axis regulation in juvenility, and perhaps in adulthood, may influence adult social status for primates that experience typical early rearing. However, early life adversity may result in dissociation between neuroendocrine stress regulation and adult social competence, which may be risk factors for adverse health outcomes.","2017","2018-12-21 17:49:16","2018-12-21 17:49:16","","92-101","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cortisol; Early experience; HPA axis; Macaca mulatta; social rank","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test the hypothesis that it is the salience of the medial geminate that detracts attention from the initial consonant we conducted three experiments with 11-month-old Italian infants. We first established baseline word-form recognition for untrained familiar trochaic disyllables and then tested for word-form recognition, separately for words with geminates and singletons, after changing the initial consonant to create nonwords from both familiar and rare forms. Familiar words with geminates were recognized despite the change, words with singletons were not. The findings indicate that a feature occurring later in the word affects initial consonant production and perception, which supports the whole-word phonology model.","2017-01","2018-12-21 17:49:17","2018-12-21 17:49:17","","158-184","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared an Internet-based manualized version of CBT group therapy for BN conducted via a therapeutic chat group (CBT4BN) to the same treatment conducted via a traditional face-to-face group therapy (CBTF2F). Method: In a two-site, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial, we tested the hypothesis that CBT4BN would not be inferior to CBTF2F. A total of 179 adult patients with BN (2.6% males) received up to 16 sessions of group CBT over 20 weeks in either CBT4BN or CBTF2F, and outcomes were compared at the end of treatment and at the 12-month follow-up. Results: At the end of treatment, CBT4BN was inferior to CBTF2F in producing abstinence from binge eating and purging. However, by the 12-month follow-up, CBT4BN was mostly not inferior to CBTF2F. Participants in the CBT4BN condition, but not CBTF2F, continued to reduce their binge-eating and purging frequency from the end of treatment to the 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: CBT delivered online in a group chat format appears to be an efficacious treatment for BN, although the trajectory of recovery may be slower than face-to-face group therapy. Online chat groups may increase accessibility of treatment and represent a cost-effective approach to service delivery. However, barriers in service delivery such as state-specific license and ethical guidelines for online therapists need to be addressed. (C) 2016 S.

This lack of originality is often due to responses being tethered to recently activated knowledge and salient examples. The current research tested the hypothesis that implicitly priming creativity results in more creativity (i.e., flexibility). Experiment 1 addressed the potential underlying mechanisms that might lead to such an effect and demonstrated that creativity priming leads to the activation of remote, as opposed to close, associations to a target item. Experiments 2a, 2b, 3, and 4 showed that priming creativity (using two different procedures) leads to more original ideas in a generative task as well as better performance in the remote association task (RAT). These effects occurred independently of the conscious intention to be creative as well as motivational and mood states. Across these studies, the activation of a creative mindset undermined the sources of inflexible and uncreative responding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Experiments 2 and 3 employed animate and inanimate word lists consisting of tightly constrained categories (four-footed animals and furniture). Experiment 2 failed to find an animacy advantage when the categorical structure was readily apparent, but the advantage returned in Experiment 3 when the embedded list procedure was employed using the same target words.

There are fewer studies on temporal variation in self-harm than in suicide. The aim of this study was to examine the seasonality of self-harm in Hong Kong and to test the hypothesis of diminishing seasonality. Methods: We used secondary data from medical records of self-harm obtained from all the public hospitals in Hong Kong under the management of the Hospital Authority. We identified 59,473 distinct episodes involving 36,411 patients. From these, monthly statistics of self-harm from January 2002 to December 2011 were calculated. Harmonic analysis was conducted to examine the presence and magnitude of seasonality. Results: A bi-seasonal pattern alongside a stronger one-cycle pattern from 2002 to 2006 was identified. During the period 1997-2001, this contracted to a one-cycle pattern with a peak in summer (May to July) and a nadir in winter (December). The magnitude of seasonality diminished greatly, as shown by harmonic analysis. The extent of diminishing seasonality was larger among women and people under 55 years old. Limitations: The study covered only self-harm patients who had visited a hospital. Cases which required no medical attention and those where the patient consulted private doctors could not be included, indicating bias towards more severe cases of injury and poisoning. Conclusion: This study provides some evidence of diminishing and even vanishing seasonality of self-harm in Hong Kong, a phenomenon mainly found in younger individuals. It could be related to the increasing use of social media to connect people, especially the younger generation. The impact of seasonal events and activities, as in the past, has become less significant in the social media era.","2017-01-01","2018-12-21 17:49:20","2018-12-21 17:49:20","","63-68","","","207","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Diminishing seasonality; Hong Kong; Seasonal variation; Self-harm; Suicide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These three constructs and the related mediation effect may characterize different psychiatric syndromes other than PSDs. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to baseline data from a longitudinal study of 138 young individuals with a recent-onset psychiatric disorder. Using SEM, we tested the hypothesis that ToM mediates the effect of neurocognition on functioning independent of the level of psychosis risk and the diagnostic category. In the mediation model the bootstrapping estimate revealed a significant indirect effect that was the association of social cognition with neurocognition and with functional outcome. ToM was significantly associated with neurocognition and the path from neurocognition to functioning was no longer significant as soon as the mediator (ToM) was entered into the mediation model consistent with a complete mediation effect through ToM. This mediation was independent of the psychosis-risk status and the psychiatric diagnoses.

Studies found that illness representations influence adherence through the mediating role of coping behaviors. However, no study has ever tested if patient engagement to the visits mediate the relationship between illness perceptions and adherence. This study aimed to explore illness representations of HIV positive patients and test the hypothesis that illness representations predict adherence through the mediating role of a component of behavioral engagement. Methods: HIV-positive patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least one year and presenting to a check-up visit were eligible to participate in the study. Patients completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised. Behavioral engagement was measured based on the patients' clinical attendance to the check-up visits; adherence to HAART was measured by viral load. Undetectable viral load or HIV RNA < 40 copies/ml were considered indexes of virologic success. Results: A total of 161 patients participated in the study. Most of them coherently attributed the experienced symptoms to HIV/HAART; perceived their condition as chronic, stable, coherent, judged the therapy as effective, and attributed their disease to the HIV virus and to their behavior or bad luck. The majority of patients (80.1%) regularly attended check-up visits and 88.5% of them reached virologic success. The mediation model did not show good fit indexes. However, a significant direct effect of two independent variables on virologic success was found. Specifically, the perception that the disease does not have serious consequences on patient's life and the prevalence of negative emotions toward HIV were associated with virologic success. On the contrary, the patient's perception that the disease has serious consequences on his/her life and the prevalence of positive emotions were associated with virologic failure. This model showed good fit indexes (CFI = 1; TLI = 1; RMSEA = 0.00; and WRMSR = 0.309). Discussion: Results do not support the mediating role of behavioral engagement in the relationship between illness representations and adherence. As perception of serious consequences coupled with positive emotions are directly associated with virologic failure, clinicians should take them into account to promote treatment adherence.","2016-12-23","2018-12-21 17:49:21","2018-12-21 17:49:21","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adherence; HAART; HIV; illness representations; IPQ-R; patient engagement; virologic success","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Life satisfaction and the relative frequency of positive and negative emotions are parts of subjective well-being. According to the prospect theory, hedonic adaptation helps to explain why positive emotion is often so hard to be maintained, and negative emotion wouldn't be easy to be eliminated. So we expect the relationship between income and positive emotion is different from that between income and negative emotion. Given that regional reference is the main comparison mechanism, effects of regional average income on regional average subjective well-being should be potentially zero if only relative income matters. Using multilevel analysis, we tested the hypotheses with a dataset of 30,144 individuals from 162 counties in China. The results suggested that household income at the individual level is associated with life satisfaction, happiness and negative emotions. On the contrary, at a county level, household income is only associated with negative emotion. In other words, happiness and life satisfaction was only associated with relative income, but negative emotion was associated with relative income and absolute income. Without social comparison, income doesn't improve happiness, but it could weaken negative emotion. Therefore, it is possible for economic growth to weaken negative emotion without improving happiness. These findings also contribute to the current debate about the “Esterling paradox.”","2016-12-21","2018-12-21 17:49:21","2018-12-21 17:49:21","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","absolute income effect; multilevel analysis; negative emotion; positive emotion; relative income effect; subjective well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the present study was to understand how adolescents subjectively evaluate the potential negative and positive consequences of drinking and to test the hypothesis that evaluations differ as a function of personal experience with alcohol use and consequences. Participants were 697 adolescents (55% female) who completed online surveys assessing lifetime drinking experience and hypothetical evaluations of 13 negative and 9 positive consequences. Never having consumed a full drink of alcohol (vs. having consumed a full drink, but not having negative consequences) was significantly associated with higher mean negative evaluations and lower mean positive evaluations. Those who had a full drink (vs. those who had not) rated close to half of the negative consequence items as significantly less bothersome, and all of the positive consequences as significantly more enjoyable. However, there was little evidence in this sample that evaluations differ between drinkers with and without experience with negative consequences. Overall, findings suggest that youth who have experience with simply consuming alcohol may place more value on the positive and less value on some of the negative consequences of drinking, which has the potential to impact decisions to continue to drink. Longitudinal research uncovering the direction of evaluation-experience effects and mechanisms other than consequence experience, are essential next steps.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:22","2018-12-21 17:49:22","","811-818","","8","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; alcohol; alcohol consequences; subjective evaluations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Levels of ADHD symptoms typically decline across childhood and adolescence, although they remain elevated for some individuals. The determinants of symptom persistence and decline are not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVES To test the hypothesis that genetic risk variant load for ADHD (indexed by polygenic risk scores [PRS]), but not for other psychiatric disorders, is associated with population-based ADHD symptom trajectories across childhood and adolescence, and to examine whether higher genetic liability for ADHD is correlated with total number of additional neurodevelopmental disorders (multimorbidity) in childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study, has been collecting data on 14 701 children, including 9757 with data on symptoms of ADHD at multiple time points, since September 6, 1990. The primary exposure variables, PRS, were generated using results of a genome-wide association study from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Childhood multimorbidity scores (ages 7-9 years) were measured by total impairments in 4 domains known to share genetic liability with ADHD: IQ, social communication, pragmatic language, and conduct. Data analysis was conducted from March 1 to September 8, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom trajectories from ages 4 to 17 years (7 time points). RESULTS Among 9757 children with data on symptoms of ADHD at multiple time points (age range, 4-17 years; 4968 boys and 4789 girls), 4 ADHD symptom trajectories were identified: low (82.6%), intermediate (7.7%), childhood-limited (5.8%), and persistent (3.9%). Mean (SE) PRS for ADHD were higher in children in the persistent trajectory (0.254 [0.069]) compared with each of the other 3 trajectories (low, -0.018 [0.014], chi(2)(1) = 14.67, P < .001, odds ratio, 1.31; intermediate, 0.054 [0.055], chi(2)(1) = 4.70, P = .03, odds ratio, 1.22; and childhood-limited, 0.017 [0.060], chi(2)(1) = 6.50, P = .01, odds ratio, 1.27). Findings were specific to PRS for ADHD; PRS for other psychiatric conditions did not differ across trajectories. The proportion of children with multimorbidity was also highest in those in the persistent trajectory (42.5%; 95% CI, 33.9%-51.1%; P < .001) and was associated with persistence of ADHD symptoms independent of PRS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Persistence of ADHD symptoms across childhood and adolescence in the general population is associated with higher PRS for ADHD. Childhood multimorbidity was also associated with persistence of ADHD symptoms and may help to identify children with ADHD whose symptoms are most likely to continue into adolescence.","2016-12-01","2018-12-21 17:49:22","2018-12-21 17:49:22","","1285-1292","","12","73","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, it has been argued that procrastination can be conceptualized as a dysfunctional response to undesired affective states. Thus, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the availability of adaptive emotion regulation (ER) skills prevents procrastination. In a first study, cross-sectional analyses indicated that ER skills and procrastination were associated and that these connections were mediated by the ability to tolerate aversive emotions. In a second study, cross lagged panel analyses showed that (1) the ability to modify aversive emotions reduced subsequent procrastination and that (2) procrastination affected the subsequent ability to tolerate aversive emotions. Finally, in a third study, a two-arm randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted. Results indicated that systematic training of the ER skills tolerate and modify aversive emotions reduced procrastination. Thus, in order to overcome procrastination, emotion-focused strategies should be considered. (C) 2016 The Authors.

It is suggested that right and left hippocampi are affected differentially in healthy or pathologic aging. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that verbal episodic memory performance is associated with left hippocampal volume (HV) while spatial memory is associated with right HV. 115 non-demented adults over age 70 were drawn from the Einstein Aging Study. Verbal memory was measured using the free recall score from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test - immediate recall (FCSRT-IR), logical memory immediate and delayed subtests (LM-I and LM-II) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). Spatial Memory was measured using a computerized dot memory paradigm that has been validated for use in older adults. All participants underwent 3 T MRI with subsequent automatized measurement of the volume of each hippocampus. The sample had a mean age of 78.7 years (SD = 5.0); 57% were women, and 52% were white. Participants had a mean of 14.3 years (SD=3.5) of education. In regression models, two tests of verbal memory (FCSRT-IR free recall and LM-II) were positively associated with left HV, but not with right HV. Performance on the spatial memory task was associated with right HV, but not left HV. Our findings support the hypothesis that the left hippocampus plays a critical role in episodic verbal memory, while right hippocampus might be more important for spatial memory processing among non-demented older adults.

Adolescence is an important time in the development of self-concept; however, little is known about how clarity of self-concept relates to online behavior. The principal aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that self-concept clarity would be associated with adolescents' inclination to experiment with online self-presentation. One hundred forty-eight participants aged 13-18 completed the Self-Concept Clarity Scale, the Facebook Intensity Scale, and the Presentation of Online Self Scale (POSS). Adolescents possessing a less stable sense of self reported experimenting with online self-presentation more regularly, presenting an idealized version of self and a preference for presenting themselves online. Adolescents with a more stable self-concept reported presenting an online self which was more consistent with their offline self-presentation. Younger adolescents were more likely to present an inconsistent self, whereas older adolescents presented themselves more consistently across different communication contexts. Finally, adolescents who spent more time on Facebook and had fewer Facebook friends were more likely to present multiple versions of self while online. The implications of these findings will be discussed in terms of the development of self-concept during adolescence and the potential for the online world to facilitate flexible identity construction and self-presentation.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:24","2018-12-21 17:49:24","","716-720","","12","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; Facebook; self-concept clarity; self-presentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the third (fake) throw, the audience sees the ball go up and then disappear. In this article, we study the psychological mechanisms at play in this magic trick. We test the hypothesis that the illusion is based on representational momentum (RM), a psychological phenomenon in which the observer perceives the stopping point of a moving scene as being located farther ahead in the direction of motion than it really is. To determine whether the mechanisms involved in VBI are similar to those underlying RM, we compared the results of a standard VBI task to those obtained on an RM task designed to be very close to the VBI task.

Aim To test the hypothesis that diurnal fluctuations in cortisol and/or testosterone will differentiate ASPD and psychopathy among male forensic psychiatric inpatients and distinguish both groups from healthy men not in treatment. Methods One hundred and sixty-six men participated: 81 patients with ASPD, 42 of whom had a Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) score of 26 or more and 39 with a score of 25 or less, 51 forensic hospital employees and 34 general population men. None in the latter two groups had abnormal personality traits. For each person, diurnal cortisol and testosterone saliva samples were collected. Results Both patient groups and the forensic hospital employees showed significantly higher diurnal testosterone levels than the general population, community-based men. The community men showed significantly lower values in their diurnal cortisol variation than the ASPD and psychopathy groups but, in this, were similar to the forensic employee group. Neither cortisol nor testosterone levels differentiated the higher from lower Psychopathy Checklist-Revised scorers. Conclusions We replicated findings of diurnal testosterone deficiencies among men with psychopathy and ASPD, but we were unable to differentiate patients groups from each other or from the hospital employees on cortisol measures. This suggests a case for more research with more diverse comparison groups and more differentiation of personality traits before drawing definitive conclusions about distinctive hormonal patterns among men with psychopathy, as external environmental variables may prove more influential than previously suspected.

However, it is not understood whether this is a putative primary cause or a compensatory mechanism in OCD pathophysiology. Considering the polarity-dependent effects on cortical excitability of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we applied cathodal and/or anodal tDCS to the pre-SMA of OCD patients to test which current polarity might better improve symptoms. MethodsTwelve OCD patients received initially 10 anodal (n = 6) or cathodal (n = 6) daily consecutive 2 mA/20 min tDCS sessions with the active electrode placed bilaterally on the pre-SMA. In case of improvement or no change in symptoms severity, the subjects were maintained on the same current polarity for 10 more sessions. In case of symptoms worsening after the first 10 sessions they were switched to the other polarity for 10 more sessions to test the hypothesis of a polarity-dependent effect. Therefore, each subject received 20 tDCS sessions. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) were administered biweekly to assess changes in symptoms severity. ResultsAfter 10 sessions, 50% of patients who initially received anodal stimulation were switched to cathodal, while 100% of patients initially assigned to cathodal stimulation continued on the same polarity. At the end of the study, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the mean Y-BOCS scores of those patients who underwent cathodal tDCS. No pre-post difference was found in the scores of patients following anodal tDCS. ConclusionsCathodal but not anodal tDCS over the pre-SMA significantly improved OCD symptoms.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:25","2018-12-21 17:49:25","","1132-1140","","12","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anxiety; anxiety disorders; brain stimulation; clinical trials; DBS; obsessive compulsive disorder; OCD; TMS; treatment resistance; VNS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aims: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that experiencing ECT has an impact on associated stigma, as measured by patient and family knowledge of and attitudes toward ECT. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Studies with cross-sectional and/or longitudinal designs were identified. Studies were further categorized into subcategories based on participant type (patients or patient family members) and outcome domain (knowledge or attitudes). Effect size (Cohen's d) was calculated for each study and then integrated into each subcategory (participant type by outcome domain) using a random effect model. Results: Eight studies were identified as being eligible for analysis. Two studies were cross-sectional, five were longitudinal and one incorporated both designs. Analysis of the longitudinal studies indicated that experiencing ECT both increased knowledge of and improved attitudes toward ECT in patients; in family members of patients, analysis showed significant positive change in knowledge of ECT, but no significant change in attitudes toward ECT. Conclusion: Experience with ECT may have a positive impact on knowledge of and attitudes toward ECT. However, the quality of evidence of included studies was low; further research is required in order to clarify the relationship and to identify information of use to individuals considering ECT as a treatment option.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:26","2018-12-21 17:49:26","","708-718","","8","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attitude; electroconvulsive therapy; meta-analysis; stigma; systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cannabis is a widely used drug associated with increased risk for psychosis. The dopamine hypothesis of psychosis postulates that altered salience processing leads to psychosis. We therefore tested the hypothesis that cannabis users exhibit aberrant salience and explored the relationship between aberrant salience and dopamine synthesis capacity. Method. We tested 17 cannabis users and 17 age- and sex-matched non-user controls using the Salience Attribution Test, a probabilistic reward-learning task. Within users, cannabis-induced psychotic symptoms were measured with the Psychotomimetic States Inventory. Dopamine synthesis capacity, indexed as the influx rate constant Ki cer, was measured in 10 users and six controls with 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[F-18] fluoro-L-phenylalanine positron emission tomography. Results. There was no significant difference in aberrant salience between the groups [F-1,F-32 = 1.12, p = 0.30 (implicit); F-1,F-32 = 1.09, p = 0.30 (explicit)]. Within users there was a significant positive relationship between cannabis-induced psychotic symptom severity and explicit aberrant salience scores (r = 0.61, p = 0.04) and there was a significant association between cannabis dependency/abuse status and high implicit aberrant salience scores (F-1,F-15 = 5.8, p = 0.03). Within controls, implicit aberrant salience was inversely correlated with whole striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (r =-0.91, p = 0.01), whereas this relationship was non-significant within users (difference between correlations: Z =-2.05, p = 0.04). Conclusions. Aberrant salience is positively associated with cannabis-induced psychotic symptom severity, but is not seen in cannabis users overall. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the link between cannabis use and psychosis involves alterations in salience processing. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these cognitive abnormalities are pre-existing or caused by long-term cannabis use.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:27","2018-12-21 17:49:27","","3383-3395","","16","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Addiction; cannabis; dopamine; psychosis; salience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has been reported to rapidly reduce psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. This has the potential to revolutionize treatment for schizophrenia. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SNP leads to a reduction in psychotic symptoms and an improvement in spatial working memory (SWM) performance in patients with schizophrenia. Method. This was a single-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed from 27 August 2014 to 10 February 2016 (clinicaltrials. gov identifier: NCT02176044). Twenty patients with schizophrenia aged 18-60 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited from psychiatric outpatient clinics in the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK. Baseline symptoms were measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-18), and SWM was assessed using the CANTAB computerized test. Participants received either an infusion of SNP (0.5 mu g/kg per min for 4 h) or placebo and were re-assessed for symptoms and SWM performance immediately after the infusion, and 4 weeks later. Results. SNP did not lead to any reduction in psychotic symptoms or improvement in SWM performance compared to placebo. Conclusions. Although this study was negative, it is possible that the beneficial effects of SNP may occur in patients with a shorter history of illness, or with more acute exacerbation of symptoms.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:27","2018-12-21 17:49:27","","3443-3450","","16","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Clinical trial; nitric oxide; schizophrenia; sodium nitroprusside; spatial working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample consisted of 30,655 episodes of mental health treatment for 23,122 patients with psychotic disorders. Information was available about waiting time and treatment duration, source of referral, occurrence of crisis contacts, admittance to clinical care and compulsory admissions. In addition, information was available about ethnicity (based on country of birth), gender, age and marital status. Results were calculated for ethnic and gender groups separately. In addition, a number of multivariate regression analyses were conducted to correct for differences in age and marital status. There was substantial variation between ethnic minority and gender groups in relation to the treatment characteristics. Compared with a Dutch ethnic background, ethnic minority background was generally associated with less waiting time, and more police referrals, crisis contacts, admittance to clinical care and compulsory admission, but shorter treatment duration. Characteristics appeared to be least favorable in episodes that involved male patients with Antillean and Surinamese backgrounds, whereas episodes were quite similar for ethnic Dutch and Turkish patients.

Studies in adolescents and adults have identified a general psychopathology factor associated with a high risk for different psychiatric disorders. We defined a multi-informant general psychopathology factor in school-aged children and estimated its single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability. The goal was to test the hypothesis that child behavioral and emotional problems are under the influence of highly pleiotropic common autosomal genetic variants that nonspecifically increase the risk for different dimensions of psychopathology. Method: Children from the Generation R cohort were repeatedly assessed between ages 6 to 8 years. Child behavior problems were reported by parents, teachers, and children. Confirmatory factor analysis estimated a general psychopathology factor across informants using various psychiatric problem scales. Validation of the general psychopathology factor was based on IQ and temperamental measures. Genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) was used to estimate the SNP heritability (N = 2,115). Results: The general psychopathology factor was associated with lower IQ, higher negative affectivity, and lower effortful control, but not with surgency. Importantly, the general psychopathology factor showed a significant SNP heritability of 38% (SE = 0.16, p = .008). Conclusion: Common autosomal SNPs are pleiotropically associated with internalizing, externalizing, and other child behavior problems, and underlie a general psychopathology factor in childhood.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:28","2018-12-21 17:49:28","","1038-1045","","12","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","child behavior; comorbidity; genetic pleiotropy; psychopathology; SNP heritability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis of bidirectionality between LS and two components of the SPS, orientation (SPS-O) and skills (SPS-S). Two waves of data were collected from a sample of 733 adolescents at a middle school over a 6-month period. Cross-lagged panel analysis results showed that statistically, LS significantly predicted SPS-O and SPS-S after six months; however, neither SPS-O nor SPS-S significantly predicted LS after six months. These findings suggest LS may function as an antecedent of SPS-O and SPS-S among early adolescents, which lead to a main implication that both SPS and LS could be the direct aims of educational and psychological programs to promote SPS development in early adolescents. Additional implication and future directions are discussed. (C) 2016 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Study 1 included 125 adolescents and Study 2 considered 128 college-students and their mothers.

Both studies found consistent associations between UCPR and parenting practices that may support autonomous motivation. Moreover, Study 1 demonstrated that the rationale giving and choice provision were more strongly related to adolescents' autonomous motivation when adolescents perceived mothers as high on UCPR.

Recent studies show a relation between sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms and a range of adverse outcomes linked to suicidal ideation, including depression, emotion dysregulation, lowered self-esteem, and peer problems/social withdrawal, yet no study to date has examined SCT in relation to suicide risk. MethodsWe tested the hypothesis that SCT would be associated with suicide risk in a sample of 95 psychiatrically hospitalized children (74% male; 62% black) between the ages of 8 and 12 (M=10.01, SD=1.50). Parents completed measures of their child's psychiatric symptoms, including SCT and depression, as well as a measure of their own psychopathology. Children completed measures assessing loneliness and depression. Both parents and children completed measures of suicide risk. ResultsWhite children reported greater suicide risk than nonwhite children. After controlling for demographic characteristics, loneliness, parental psychopathology, and correlated psychiatric symptoms, including both parent- and child self-reported depressive symptoms, SCT remained uniquely associated with children's suicide risk. Results were consistent across both parent and child measures of suicide risk. ConclusionsThis multi-informant study provides strong preliminary support for an association between SCT symptoms and suicide risk in psychiatrically hospitalized children, above and beyond loneliness, depression, and demographic characteristics. Findings are discussed in the context of the interpersonal theory of suicide. Additional studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings, with a particular need for studies that examine the cognitive processes and daydreaming content of individuals displaying elevated SCT symptomatology.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:30","2018-12-21 17:49:30","","1390-1399","","12","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention-deficit; daydreaming; depression; hyperactivity disorder; inpatient; rumination; self-injury; suicidal ideation; suicidal imagery; suicidality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While past studies demonstrate the preservation of real-world features such as size and distance during mental simulation, their temporal dynamics remains unknown. Here, we compare mental simulations to navigation of routes in a large-scale spatial environment to test the hypothesis that such simulations are temporally compressed in an adaptive manner. Our results show that simulations occurred at 2.39x the speed it took to navigate a route, increasing in compression (3.57x) for slower movement speeds. Participant self-reports of vividness and spatial coherence of simulations also correlated strongly with simulation duration, providing an important link between subjective experiences of simulated events and how spatial representations are combined during prospection. These findings suggest that simulation of spatial events involve adaptive temporal mechanisms, mediated partly by the fidelity of memories used to generate the simulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In a background of interest in staging models in psychiatry, we tested the validity of a simple staging model of cognitive impairment to predict incident dementia. Method. A large community sample of adults aged 55 years (N = 4803) was assessed in the baseline of a longitudinal, four-wave epidemiological enquiry. A two-phase assessment was implemented in each wave, and the instruments used included the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE); the History and Aetiology Schedule and the Geriatric Mental State-AGECAT. For the standardised degree of cognitive impairment Perneczky et al's MMSE criteria were applied. A panel of psychiatrists diagnosed cases of dementia according to DSM-IV criteria, and cases and sub-cases of dementia were excluded for the follow-up waves. Competing risk regression models, adjusted by potential confounders, were used to test the hypothesised association between MMSE levels and dementia risk. Results. Out of the 4057 participants followed up, 607 (14.9%) were classified as normal' (no cognitive impairment), 2672 (65.8%) as questionable' cognitive impairment, 732 (18.0%) had mild' cognitive impairment, 38 (0.9%) had moderate' cognitive impairment and eight (0.2%) had severe' impairment. Cognitive impairment was associated with risk of dementia, the risk increasing in parallel with the level of impairment (hazard ratio: 2.72, 4.78 and 8.38 in the questionable', mild' and moderate' level of cognitive impairment, respectively).

In addition, physical dimensions, such as weight or font size, were shown to affect judgments of learning (JOLs, an estimation of the likelihood that an item will be remembered later, or its perceived memorability). In two experiments we tested the hypothesis that differences in positioning words in vertical space may affect their perceived memorability, i.e., JOLs. In both Experiments, the words were presented in lower or in upper screen locations. In Experiment 1, JOLs were collected in the centre of the screen following word presentation. In Experiment 2, JOLs were collected at the point of word presentation and in the same location. In both experiments participants completed a free recall test. JOLs were compared between different vertically displaced presentation locations. In general, Bayesian analyses showed evidence in support for the null effect of vertical location on JOLs.

In addition, control (gender, field of study, study level) and moderator variables (mobile capabilities, level of mobile usage, and frequent use of m-services) were introduced to verify the individual differences between respondents on the key factors. affecting the adoption and usage of m-learning. Structural equations modeling and path analysis were used to test the hypotheses and the proposed model. The results revealed that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were found to be the primary factors driving students' intentions to use m-learning. Both m-learning services and social influence have positive effects on the acceptance of m-learning, while mobile limitations were found to be the main obstacle restraining students' participation in a m-learning environment. Most of the control variables yield no significant differences between students, but all the moderator variables were found to be significant determinants that can influence students to adopt m-learning. Overall, students have great potential to engage and integrate mobile technology into their educational environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, an important goal for society should be to improve math readiness in preschool-age children, especially in low-income children who typically arrive in kindergarten with less mathematical competency than their higher income peers. The majority of existing research-based math intervention programs target symbolic verbal number concepts in young children. However, very little attention has been paid to the preverbal intuitive ability to approximately represent numerical quantity, which is hypothesized to be an important foundation for full-fledged mathematical thinking. Here, we tested the hypothesis that repeated engagement of non-symbolit approximate addition and subtraction of large arrays of items results in improved math skills in very young children, an idea that stems from our previous studies in adults. In the current study, 3- to 5-year-olds showed selective improvements in math skills after multiple days of playing a tablet-based non-symbolic approximate arithmetic game compared with children who played a memory game. These findings, collectively with our previous reports, suggest that mental manipulation of approximate numerosities provides an important tool for improving math readiness, even in preschoolers who have yet to master the meaning of number words.

Methods: Healthy participants viewed pictures depicting trauma scenes either with or without accompanying moderate (Le. survival, recovery) or severe (Le. fatality, permanent injury) outcome information. All participants viewed the same depictions of trauma scenes. Involuntary memories for the pictures were assessed using self-report diaries and an adapted version of the Impact of Event Scales (IES). A blurred picture perceptual priming paradigm was adapted to be used as an intrusion provocation task. Results: The severe outcome group experienced a significantly higher frequency of intrusions on the intrusion provocation task in comparison to both moderate outcome and control (no-context) conditions. The severe outcome condition did not increase intrusions on the self-report diaries or the adapted IES. There was no effect of condition on ratings for the emotionality, self-relevance, valence, or seriousness of the trauma scenes. Limitations: The analogue method should not be generalized directly to incidences of real-life trauma. It was unclear why differences in intrusion frequency were found in the provocation task only. The relative amount of individual conceptual and data-driven processing adopted by the participants was not assessed. Conclusions: Manipulating contextual information that determines the meaning of sensory-perceptual features for a trauma scene can modulate subsequent intrusion frequency in response to visually similar cues.

Competing hypotheses arguing for the reverse effect were also tested. The study was a cross-sectional survey in a community sample (N=2350) from Germany (n=786), Indonesia (n=844), and the United States (n=720). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path analysis with structural equation modeling were used to test the hypotheses. In the CFA two factors reflecting current and past experiences of SD could be identified with acceptable fit. Path analysis indicated acceptable fit for both SD and reverse models, and both the path from current SD to psychotic symptoms and the reverse one were significant, although the former was stronger than the latter. Interestingly, the current but not the past SD factor was significantly associated with psychotic symptoms. Overall, the results indicate that postulates derived from the SD hypothesis fit the data. However, longitudinal research is needed to further confirm the postulated directionality of the associations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A potential mechanism by which this occurs is through upregulation of growth hormone (GH) in the amygdala. Here we test the hypotheses that GH promotes the over-encoding of fearful memories by increasing the number of neurons activated during memory encoding and biasing the allocation of neuronal activation, one aspect of the process by which neurons compete to encode memories, to favor neurons that have stronger inputs. Viral overexpression of GH in the amygdala increased the number of amygdala cells activated by fear memory formation. GH-overexpressing cells were especially biased to express the immediate early gene c-Fos after fear conditioning, revealing strong autocrine actions of GH in the amygdala. In addition, we observed dramatically enhanced dendritic spine density in GH-overexpressing neurons. These data elucidate a previously unrecognized autocrine role for GH in the regulation of amygdala neuron function and identify specific mechanisms by which chronic stress, by enhancing GH in the amygdala, may predispose an individual to excessive fear memory formation.","2016-11-29","2018-12-21 17:49:36","2018-12-21 17:49:36","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of prior phosphorus-31 (P-31)-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), post-mortem and preclinical studies, this study was designed to test the hypothesis that abnormal glycolysis leads to elevated lactate concentrations in subjects with schizophrenia. The high sensitivity of 7 Tesla proton (H-1)-MRS was used to measure brain lactate levels in vivo. Twenty-nine controls and 27 participants with schizophrenia completed the study. MRS scanning was conducted on a Philips `Achieva' 7T scanner, and spectra were acquired from a voxel in the anterior cingulate cortex. Patients were assessed for psychiatric symptom severity, and all participants completed the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and University of California, San Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA). The relationship between lactate, psychiatric symptom severity, MCCB and UPSA was examined. Lactate was significantly higher in patients compared with controls (P = 0.013). Higher lactate was associated with lower MCCB (r = -0.36, P = 0.01) and UPSA total scores (r = -0.43, P = 0.001). We believe this is the first study to report elevated in vivo cerebral lactate levels in schizophrenia. Elevated lactate levels in schizophrenia may reflect increased anaerobic glycolysis possibly because of mitochondrial dysfunction. This study also suggests that altered cerebral bioenergetics contribute to cognitive and functional impairments in schizophrenia.","2016-11-29","2018-12-21 17:49:36","2018-12-21 17:49:36","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is currently difficult to determine which individual initiates vocalizations, or who responds to whom. To this aim, we designed a method that allows analyzing group vocal network while controlling for spatial networks, by positioning each group member in equidistant individual cages and analyzing continuous vocal interactions semi-automatically. We applied this method to two types of zebra finch groups, composed of either two adult females and two juveniles, or four young adults (juveniles from the first groups). Young often co-occur in the same social group as adults but are likely to have a different social role, which may be reflected in their vocal interactions. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the social structure of the group influences the parameters of the group vocal network. We found that groups including juveniles presented periods with higher level of activity than groups composed of young adults. Using two types of analyses (Markov analysis and cross-correlation), we showed that juveniles as well as adults were more likely to respond to individuals of their own age-class (i.e. to call one after another, in terms of turn-taking, and within a short time-window, in terms of time delay). When juveniles turned into adulthood, they showed adult characteristics of vocal patterns. Together our results suggest that vocal behavior changes during ontogeny, and individuals are more strongly connected with individuals of the same age-class within acoustic networks.","2016-11-29","2018-12-21 17:49:37","2018-12-21 17:49:37","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","acoustic communication; conversation rules; development; ontogeny; songbird; turn-taking; vocal interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Critics suggest this in part can be explained by RCTs studying newly introduced CTO regimes and that patients therefore were not brought back to hospital for short-term observations ('recall') as frequently as intended. Our purpose was (i) to test the hypothesis that CTO practice as regards recall of patients to hospital in England and Wales was as rigorous under the OCTET trial period as in current routine use and (ii) to investigate the reasons for and outcomes of recalls and whether this changed over time. Method: Thirty six-month observational prospective study of 198 patients in the OCTET Follow-up Study. Results: Forty percent of patients were recalled, 19 % more than once. This is in line with current national use. Deterioration in clinical condition was the most common reason for recalls (49 %), and 68 % of recalls resulted in revocation of the order (i.e., retention in hospital under compulsion). This pattern remained stable over time. Conclusion: The use of recall cannot explain why RCTs have not confirmed any benefits from CTOs, and their continued use should be reconsidered.","2016-11-09","2018-12-21 17:49:37","2018-12-21 17:49:37","","","","","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Community compulsion; Community Treatment Order; OCTET trial; Outpatient Commitment; Recall; Revocation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prenatal undernutrition, a severe early-life stressor, is associated with double the risk of coronary heart disease and increased blood pressure responses to psychological stress. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal undernutrition induces alterations in the autonomic nervous system, which may increase the risk of developing heart disease. Methods: We studied autonomic function in 740 men and women (mean [SD] age, 58 [0.9] years) who were members of the Dutch famine birth cohort. We compared those exposed to famine during early (n = 64), mid (n = 107), or late gestation (n = 127) to those unexposed to famine in utero (n = 442). Participants underwent a series of 3 psychological stressors (Stroop, mirror tracing, and speech) while their blood pressure and heart rate were recorded continuously. Results: Data had sufficient quality in 602 participants for derivation of autonomic function indices by spectral analysis. The stress protocol led to significant sample-level changes in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and all cardiovascular control measures (all p values < .001). None of the autonomic function parameters, at rest or in response to stress, differed significantly (all p values > .050) according to prenatal famine exposure. Conclusions: Prenatal undernutrition was not associated with autonomic function in late adulthood. We conclude that altered autonomic function does not seem to explain our previous findings of increased coronary heart disease risk among those exposed to famine prenatally.","2016-12","2018-12-21 17:49:38","2018-12-21 17:49:38","","991-997","","9","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","autonomic function; famine; heart disease; prenatal undernutrition; psychological stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: The study used cross-sectional data from 768 participants from the most recent administration of the SCI Longitudinal Aging Study, which was initiated in 1973. Measures included the revised version of the Life Situation Questionnaire, items from the Craig Handicap Assessment Reporting Technique, and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Indicators of social isolation were combined into scales assessing social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. We tested the hypothesized model of social isolation, including both social disconnectedness and perceived isolation, after SCI using structural equation modeling. Results: Results of structural equation modeling indicated good fit between the hypothesized model and data (root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.073, 90% confidence interval [0.070, 0.075]; comparative fit index = 0.949; Tucker Lewis Index = 0.946). Perceived isolation was significantly related with social disconnectedness (standardized coefficient [r] = .610). Several exogenous factors were significantly related to social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. Older participants were more likely to report lower levels of perceived isolation. Time since injury demonstrated an inverse relationship with both social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. Higher level and severity of injury were associated with higher levels of social disconnectedness. Conclusion: Our study establishes a stable model of social isolation to guide future research exploring the effect of social isolation on health after SCI.","2016-11","2018-12-21 17:49:42","2018-12-21 17:49:42","","408-416","","4","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; social isolation; spinal cord injury; structural equation modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used data from 39 countries in the World Health Survey (n = 176 934) to test the hypothesis that stress sensitivity would be associated with psychotic experiences, using logistic regression analyses. Respondents in low-income countries reported higher stress sensitivity (P < .001) and prevalence of psychotic experiences (P < .001), compared to individuals in middle-income countries. Greater stress sensitivity was associated with increased odds for psychotic experiences, even when adjusted for co-occurring anxiety and depressive symptoms: adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.15-1.19) per unit increase in stress sensitivity (range 2-10). This association was consistent and significant across nearly every country studied, and translated into a difference in psychotic experience prevalence ranging from 6.4% among those with the lowest levels of stress sensitivity up to 22.2% among those with the highest levels.

The patients in this cohort were treated prior to the establishment of early intervention services. The study aimed to test the hypothesis that those who develop psychosis at a younger age have worse outcomes than those who develop psychosis at an older age. Methods: Data on first-episode psychosis patients from the aeSOP-10 longitudinal follow-up study were used to compare baseline characteristics, and 10-year clinical, functional and service use outcomes between those patients who would and would not have met age-based criteria for early intervention services, in Australia or in the United Kingdom. Results: In total, 58% men and 71% women with first-episode psychosis were too old to meet current Australian-early intervention age-entry criteria ((2) = 9.1, p = 0.003), while 21% men and 34% women were too old for UK-early intervention age-entry criteria ((2) = 11.1, p = 0.001). The 10-year clinical and functional outcomes did not differ significantly between groups by either Australian- or UK-early intervention age-entry criteria. Service use was significantly greater among the patients young enough to meet early intervention age-criteria (Australia: incidence rate ratio = 1.35 [1.19, 1.52], p < 0.001; United Kingdom: incidence rate ratio = 1.65 [1.41, 1.93], p < 0.001). Conclusion: Current early intervention services are gender- and age-inequitable. Large numbers of patients with first-episode psychosis will not receive early intervention care under current service provision. Illness outcomes at 10-years were no worse in first-episode psychosis patients who presented within the age range for whom early intervention has been prioritised, though these patients had greater service use. These data provide a rationale to consider extension of early intervention to all, rather than just to youth.","2016-11","2018-12-21 17:49:44","2018-12-21 17:49:44","","1055-1063","","11","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","early intervention; outcomes; Psychosis; schizophrenia; women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings supported this mediational model, showing a positive link between more nurturing family environments in childhood and greater security of attachment to spouses more than 60 years later.

To further improve its efficacy, we developed a Problem Solving-Adherence (PSA) intervention integrating problem solving into adherence enhancement procedures. We tested the hypothesis that PSA is more effective than PID-C in reducing depressive symptoms. Exploratory analyses sought to identify patients with distinct depressive symptom trajectories and compare their clinical profiles. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Acute inpatient rehabilitation and community. Participants: A total of 101 diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and major depression after screening 633 consecutive admissions for acute inpatient rehabilitation. Intervention: Fourteen sessions of PID-C versus PSA over 26 weeks. Measurements: 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Results: PSA was not more efficacious than PID-C in reducing depressive symptoms. Exploratory latent class growth modeling identified two distinct depressive symptoms trajectories. Unlike patients with unfavorable course (28%) who remained symptomatic, patients with favorable course (72%) had a decline of symptoms during the hospitalization followed by a milder decline after discharge. Patients with unfavorable course were younger and had greater scores in disability, anxiety, neuroticism, and dyspnea related limitation in activities and lower self-efficacy scores. Conclusions: Both interventions led to sustained improvement depressive symptoms. PID-C matches the skills of clinicians employed by community rehabilitation programs and can be integrated in the care of depressed COPD patients. Patients with severe disability, anxiety, neuroticism, and low selfefficacy are at risk for poor outcomes and in need of close follow-up and targeted interventions.","2016-11","2018-12-21 17:49:46","2018-12-21 17:49:46","","964-974","","11","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","clinical trial; COPD; disability; dyspnea; geriatric depression; personalized intervention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a pathological entity producing such a deficit has not been identified. The authors tested the hypothesis that cortical parvalbumin interneurons receive fewer excitatory synaptic inputs in individuals with schizophrenia. Method: Fluorescent immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and post-image processing techniques were used to quantify the number of putative excitatory synapses (i.e., the overlap of vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive [VGlut1+]puncta and postsynaptic density protein 95-positive [PSD95+] puncta) per surface area of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) or calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from schizophrenia subjects and matched unaffected comparison subjects. Results: Mean density of VUut1+/PSD95+ puncta on PV+ neurons was 18% lower in schizophrenia, a significant difference. This deficit was not influenced by methodological confounds or schizophrenia-associated comorbid factors, not present in monkeys chronically exposed to antipsychotic medications, and not present in CR+ neurons. Mean density of VGlut1+/PSD95+ puncta on PV+ neurons predicted the activity-dependent expression levels of parvalbumin and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) in schizophrenia subjects but not comparison subjects. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration that excitatory synapse density is lower selectively on parvalbumin interneurons in schizophrenia and predicts the activity-dependent down-regulation of parvalbumin and GAD67. Because the activity of parvalbumin interneurons is required for generation of cortical gamma oscillations and working memory function, these findings reveal a novel pathological substrate for cortical dysfunction and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.","2016-11","2018-12-21 17:49:46","2018-12-21 17:49:46","","1131-1139","","11","173","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these approaches still show limited reliability and do not consider other critical aspects, such as situated, unconscious goals and the tendency to perceive related affordances. In order to test the hypothesis that technology evaluation may be influenced by unconscious goals, forty participants were split in two groups. The experimental session included two phases. In the first phase, each group explored a virtual environment that primed a specific goal. In the second phase, participants were asked to evaluate the usefulness and the easiness of use of two versions of the same technology (a mobile devices interface). Results showed that each group evaluated as more useful the version of the technology which featured an affordance related to the respective primed goal.

Even some firms regard KMS as an emerging and powerful source of competitive advantages. However, the implementation of KMS differs from that of traditional enterprise information systems. The implementation of KMS is difficult and risky since these systems are unstructured and so technologically innovative. Thus, effort is required to identify determinants affecting KMS implementation in businesses. Based on innovation diffusion theory and technology-organization-environment framework, this study develops and tests an integrated model of knowledge management systems implementation for businesses. Survey data were collected from 291 businesses in Taiwan. Confirmatory factor analysis and logistic regression technique were used test the hypothesized relationships. The results show that technological innovation factors (perceived benefits, complexity, and compatibility), organizational factors (top management support, organizational culture), and environmental factors (competitive pressure) are significant influences on KMS implementation in firms. Finally, the implications and future research on KMS implementation are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study tests the hypothesis that exposure to trauma and bullying may strengthen the relation between depression and psychotic experiences. A total of 799 college students completed self-report questionnaires on psychotic experiences, depression, bullying, and sexual trauma. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to test the direct relationship between depression and psychotic experiences, as well as interactions. Approximately 20% of respondents reported a history of being bullied, and 7% reported exposure to childhood sexual trauma. There was a significant direct relationship between depression and psychotic experiences. The association between depression and psychotic experiences was significantly stronger among respondents who were victims of both bullying and sexual violence compared to those who experienced either exposure alone, or who were not exposed to either form of victimization. These findings suggest that cumulative exposure to trauma and victimization may contribute to the co-occurrence of depression and psychotic experiences. History of victimization should be assessed among individuals with depressive symptoms to improve treatment plans and outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), prevents the development of many of these inflammation-induced preclinical behaviors. However, dysregulation in the balance of downstream metabolism, where neuroactive kynurenines are generated, is hypothesized to be a functionally important pathogenic feature of inflammation-induced depression. Here we utilized two novel transgenic mouse strains to directly test the hypothesis that neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism causes depressive-like behavior following peripheral immune activation. Wild-type (WT) or kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO)-deficient (KMO-/-) mice were administered either lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 mg kg(-1)) or saline intraperitoneally. Depressive-like behavior was measured across multiple domains 24 h after immune challenge. LPS precipitated a robust depressive-like phenotype, but KMO-/- mice were specifically protected from LPS-induced immobility in the tail suspension test (TST) and reduced spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze. Direct administration of 3-hydroxykynurenine, the metabolic product of KMO, caused a dose-dependent increase in depressive-like behaviors. Mice with targeted deletion of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase (HAAO), the enzyme that generates quinolinic acid, were similarly challenged with LPS. Similar to KMO-/- mice, LPS failed to increase immobility during the TST. Whereas kynurenine metabolism was generally increased in behaviorally salient brain regions, a distinct shift toward KMO-dependent kynurenine metabolism occurred in the dorsal hippocampus in response to LPS. Together, these results demonstrate that KMO is a pivotal mediator of hippocampal-dependent depressive-like behaviors induced by peripheral LPS challenge.","2016-10-18","2018-12-21 17:49:49","2018-12-21 17:49:49","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that an abnormality in membrane lipid composition may contribute to aberrant dopamine signaling, and thereby symptoms and cognitive impairment, in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. Antipsychotic-medicated and clinically stable SCZ outpatients (n = 74) were compared with matched healthy subjects (HC, n = 40). A lipidomic analysis was performed in red blood cell (RBC) membranes examining the major phospholipid (PL) classes and their associated fatty acids (FAs). Clinical manifestations were examined using the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Cognitive function was assessed using the Continuous Performance Test, Salience Attribution Test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Sphingomyelin (SM) percentage was the lipid abnormality most robustly associated with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Two groups of patients were defined. The first group (SCZ c/SM-) is characterized by a low SM membrane content. In this group, all other PL classes, plasmalogen and key polyunsaturated FAs known to be involved in brain function, were significantly modified, identifying a very specific membrane lipid cluster. The second patient group (SCZ c/SM+) was similar to HCs in terms of RBC membrane SM composition. Compared with SCZ c/SM+, SCZ c/SM- patients were characterized by significantly more severe PANSS total, positive, disorganized/cognitive and excited psychopathology. Cognitive performance was also significantly poorer in this subgroup. These data show that a specific RBC membrane lipid cluster is associated with clinical and cognitive manifestations of dopamine dysfunction in schizophrenia patients. We speculate that this membrane lipid abnormality influences presynaptic dopamine signaling.","2016-10-04","2018-12-21 17:49:50","2018-12-21 17:49:50","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How do musicians manage this? We tested the hypothesis that they achieve the necessary spontaneity by varying the musical gestures that express their interpretation of a piece. We examined the tempo arches produced by final slowing at the ends of phrases in performances of J. S. Bach's No. 6 (Prelude) for solo cello (12 performances) and the Italian Concerto (Presto) for solo piano (eight performances). The performances were given by two experienced concert soloists during a short time period (31/2 months for the Prelude, 2 weeks for the Presto) after completing their preparations for public performance. We measured the tempo of each bar or half-bar, and the stability of tempo across performances (difference of the tempo of each bar/half bar from each of the other performances). There were phrase arches for both tempo and stability with slower, less stable tempi at beginnings and ends of phrases and faster, more stable tempi mid-phrase. The effects of practice were complex. Tempo decreased overall with practice, while stability increased in some bars and decreased in others. One effect of practice may be to imbue well-learned, automatic motor sequences with freshness and spontaneity through cognitive control at phrase boundaries where slower tempi and decreased stability provide opportunities for slower cognitive processes to modulate rapid automatic motor sequences.","2016-10-04","2018-12-21 17:49:50","2018-12-21 17:49:50","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","expression; expressive timing; musical gesture; performance; practice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a cross-sectional, correlational design, 9th grade students (N = 3,383; mean age = 14.6 years) in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. completed surveys in 2013 measuring conduct problems (e.g., stealing, lying, getting in fights); alternative and complementary reinforcement; use of a number of licit, illicit, and prescription drugs; and other cofactors. Conduct problems were positively associated with past 6-month use of any substance (yes/no) among the overall sample and past 30-day use frequency on a composite index that included 6 substances among past 6-month users. These associations were statistically mediated by diminished alternative reinforcement and increased complementary reinforcement when adjusting for relevant covariates. Conduct problems were associated with lower engagement in alternative reinforcers and increased engagement in complementary reinforcers, which, in turn, were associated with greater likelihood and frequency of substance use. Most mediational relations persisted adjusting for demographic, environmental, and intrapersonal cofactors and generalized to alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use, although, complementary reinforcers did not significantly mediate the relation of conduct problems with alcohol use frequency. These results point to diminished alternative reinforcement and increased complementary reinforcement as mechanisms linking conduct problems and adolescent substance use. Interventions that increase access to and engagement in a diverse set of alternative substance-free activities and deter activities that complement use may prevent substance use in adolescents who engage in conduct problems.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:49:51","2018-12-21 17:49:51","","376-389","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; alternative reinforcers; complementary reinforcers; conduct problems; substance use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current article, we argue that Chan and LaPaglia's (2013) findings are open to alternative interpretations, and further test the hypothesis that reactivation increases a witnessed memory's susceptibility to impairment. To this end, the current studies used a different set of materials and a different measure of memory impairment, the Modified Recognition Test (McCloskey & Zaragoza, 1985). In Experiment 1a, we established that our reactivation manipulation was effective by showing that we could replicate the well-established retrieval enhanced suggestibility effect with our materials. However, when we assessed potential impairment of the witnessed memory with the Modified Recognition Test (Experiments 1a and 1b), we failed to find evidence that reactivating the witnessed memory prior to misinformation impaired memory for the originally witnessed event. In Experiment 2, we replicated Chan and LaPaglia's (2013) findings when we used their memory impairment measure (misinformation-free True/False Recognition Test) and showed why that test does not permit clear inferences about memory impairment. Collectively, the results showed that, although the reactivation manipulation increased susceptibility to suggestion (i.e., as evidenced by increased reporting of suggested misinformation), there was no evidence that reactivation through testing increased the original memory's susceptibility to impairment.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:49:51","2018-12-21 17:49:51","","1544-1558","","10","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","eyewitness memory; memory impairment; misinformation; reconsolidation; retrieval enhanced suggestibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that obsessive beliefs uniquely predict BID after controlling for other related variables. A total of 601 participants completed a battery of self-report measures of BID severity, obsessive beliefs, OCD symptoms, general distress, and pathological eating attitudes. As predicted, BID was positively correlated with all three obsessive belief domains. Contrary to hypotheses, only the need for perfectionism/certainty obsessive belief domain emerged as a significant unique predictor of BID. Limitations and potential implications for understanding, assessing, and treating BID-related conditions are discussed.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:49:52","2018-12-21 17:49:52","","96-100","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinicians and clinical psychology professors in the current study identified 143 persons who fit a description of either a grandiose or a vulnerable narcissist and indicated the extent to which these persons ever demonstrated traits of the complementary variant. The results supported the fluctuation hypothesis, particularly for episodes of vulnerable narcissism in persons identified as a grandiose narcissist.

Study 1 demonstrates that experimentally induced boredom leads to more extreme political orientations. Study 2 indicates that people who become easily bored with their environment adhere to more extreme ends of a political spectrum compared with their less easily bored counterparts. Finally, Study 3 reveals that the relatively extreme political orientations among those who are easily bored can be attributed to their enhanced search for meaning.

We examined women's perceptions regarding the changes in their social relations within their neighbourhood, within their marriage and with their children; analysed the factors that were associated with these relations; and tested the hypothesis that an improvement in social relations will protect women's mental health from the negative impact of earthquake trauma. Participants consisted of a random selection of 1253 women, who were interviewed regarding their psychosocial needs and mental health status 1 year after earthquake. They reported trauma-related changes in their social relations; their mental health was evaluated using the Post Traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Our study demonstrated severe earthquake trauma was associated with deteriorated social relations, especially neighbourhood and marital relations. Deteriorated marital and child relations were associated with increased levels of psychiatric distress; deteriorated neighbourhood relations were associated with intrusive posttraumatic stress symptoms. Improved neighbourhood relations, but not family relations, were able to protect women's mental health from the negative impact of trauma. The results are discussed regarding their relevance to gender effects and the provision of relation-specific and symptom-specific disaster relief.

We previously reported that intravenous (i.v.) exogenous ghrelin increases alcohol craving. We also reported i.v. ghrelin reduces endogenous serum leptin, whose levels, in turn, negatively correlated with alcohol craving. Exogenous ghrelin administration decreases insulin secretion both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This study tested the hypothesis that i.v. ghrelin may also decrease endogenous serum insulin levels in alcoholic individuals. Additionally, we explored possible correlations between serum insulin and alcohol craving, since a correlation between insulin and alcohol craving was previously reported. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory study (n=43). Non-treatment-seeking, alcohol-dependent, heavy drinkers were randomized to receive i.v. ghrelin or placebo, followed by an alcohol cue-reactivity procedure. There was a main effect for i.v. ghrelin, compared to placebo in reducing serum insulin (P <.05). There was also a time effect (P <.001) but not ghrelin x time interaction (P >.05). We did not find a correlation between the reduction of serum insulin and alcohol craving (P >.05). The change in serum insulin was consistent with a parallel reduction in serum connective-peptide in the ghrelin group compared with placebo, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P=.076). No similar effects were found for other glucose-regulating hormones analyzed i.e. glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, and gastric inhibitory peptide (Ps >.05). These findings indicate i.v. ghrelin administration has an effect on reducing serum insulin in alcohol-dependent individuals; however, the reduction of insulin did not correlate with changes in alcohol cue-elicited craving. We speculate that, unlike for leptin, the interactions between ghrelin and insulin relationship are limited at the peripheral level. However, mechanistic studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:49:55","2018-12-21 17:49:55","","","","10","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol craving; alcoholism; ghrelin; glucagon; incretins; insulin; leptin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several prior studies find reduced volume and thickness of prefrontal (PFC) and temporal cortex regions in abused compared with nonabused adolescents, although most prior research is based on adults and volume-based measures. This study tests the hypothesis that child abuse, independent of parental education, predicts reduced cortical thickness in prefrontal and temporal cortices as well as reduced gray mater volume (GMV) in subcortical regions during adolescence. Methods: Structural MRI scans were obtained from 21 adolescents exposed to physical and/or sexual abuse and 37 nonabused adolescents (ages 13-20). Abuse was operationalized using dichotomous and continuous measures. We examined associations between abuse and brain structure in several a priori-defined regions, controlling for parental education, age, sex, race, and total brain volume for subcortical GMV. Significance was evaluated at p < .05 with a false discovery rate correction. Results: Child abuse exposure and severity were associated with reduced thickness in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), left temporal pole, and bilateral inferior, right middle, and right superior temporal gyri. Neither abuse measure predicted cortical surface area or subcortical GMV. Bilateral PHG thickness was inversely related to externalizing symptoms. Conclusions: Child abuse, an experience characterized by a high degree of threat, is associated with reduced cortical thickness in ventromedial and ventrolateral PFC and medial and lateral temporal cortex in adolescence. Reduced PHG thickness may be a mediator linking abuse with externalizing psychopathology, although prospective research is needed to evaluate this possibility.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:49:56","2018-12-21 17:49:56","","1154-1164","","10","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Abuse; childhood adversity; cortical thickness; temporal cortex; ventromedial prefrontal cortex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The style theory is the Assimilator (rule oriented, familiarity seeking)-Explorer (novelty seeking, explorative) styles (Kaufmann, 1979). Our hypothesis is that the effectiveness of 2 types of search constraints (prior experience and solution hints) for solving insight problems is moderated by both cognitive style and achievement needs, and depending on optimal levels of achievement motivation for different task conditions. We tested the hypothesis in a randomized experiment in which 3 levels of achievement needs and 1 type of search constraint (solution hints were available or not available) were experimentally manipulated. In addition, participants completed a cognitive style test, a measure of prior problem-solving experience (the second type of search constraint), and controls for intelligence. There were 476 participants (the mean age was 18.4 years). Results revealed 2 similar and significant 3-way interactions between styles, achievement needs, and the 2 types of search constraints. The pattern of interaction supported the idea that stylistic competence for the task characteristics (with and without search constraints available), when combined with manipulated achievement needs, predicted performance in counterintuitive ways but in line with the classic achievement motivation theory. With appropriate stylistic competence for the task characteristics elevated achievement needs led to poorer performance. With less appropriate stylistic competence, performance improved with increasing motivation. Implications for information processing theory are discussed.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:49:57","2018-12-21 17:49:57","","1319-1332","","10","145","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","achievement motivation; cognitive style; creativity; information processing; insight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among these are patterns of abnormal cortical connectivity and abnormal basal ganglia development. In attempts to integrate the existing literature, the current paper tests the hypothesis that impairments in the basal ganglia's function to flexibly select and route task-relevant neural signals to the prefrontal cortex underpins patterns of abnormal synchronization between the prefrontal cortex and other cortical processing centers observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We tested this hypothesis using a Dynamic Causal Modeling analysis of neuroimaging data collected from 16 individuals with ASD (mean age = 25.3 years; 6 female) and 17 age- and IQ-matched neurotypical controls (mean age=25.6, 6 female), who performed a Go/No-Go test of executive functioning. Consistent with the hypothesis tested, a random-effects Bayesian model selection procedure determined that a model of network connectivity in which basal ganglia activation modulated connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and other key cortical processing centers best fit the data of both neurotypicals and individuals with ASD. Follow-up analyses suggested that the largest group differences were observed for modulation of connectivity between prefrontal cortex and the sensory input region in the occipital lobe [t(31)=2.03, p = 0.025]. Specifically, basal ganglia activation was associated with a small decrease in synchronization between the occipital region and prefrontal cortical regions in controls; however, in individuals with ASD, basal ganglia activation resulted in increased synchronization between the occipital region and the prefrontal cortex. We propose that this increased synchronization may reflect a failure in basal ganglia signal gating mechanisms, resulting in a non-selective copying of signals to prefrontal cortex. Such a failure to prioritize and filter signals to the prefrontal cortex could result in the pervasive impairments in cognitive flexibility and executive functioning that characterize autism spectrum disorder, and may offer a mechanistic explanation of some of the observed abnormalities in patterns of cortical synchronization in ASD.

In the study presented here, we used transcranial direct current stimulation to test the hypothesis that a domain general dorsolateral prefrontal cognitive control network is involved in constraining the complex processing involved. Specifically, we sought to test prominent theoretical stances on the division of labour across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the left- and right-hemispheres of the brain, including the role of salience and fine vs. coarse semantic coding. 32 healthy young adult participants were randomly allocated to one of two stimulation montage groups (LH anodal/RH cathodal or RH anodal/LH cathodal). Participants were tested twice, completing a semantic decision task after either receiving active or sham stimulation. The semantic decision task required participants to judge the relatedness of an idiom and a target word. The target word was figuratively related, literally related, or unrelated to the idiom. Control non-literal non-idiomatic sentences were also included that only had a literal meaning. The results showed that left-hemisphere dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is highly involved in processing figurative language, whereas both left- and right-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex contributed to literal language processing. In comparison, semantic processing for the non-idiomatic control sentences did not require domain general cognitive control as it relates to suppression of the rejected alternative meaning. The results are discussed in terms of the interplay between need for domain general cognitive control in understanding the meaning of complex sentences, hemispheric differences in semantic processing, and salience detection.

MethodThis is a cross-sectional study, including young adults with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and matched controls without any mood disorder. Childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The Hicks and Tingley implementation was employed to assess whether trauma is a mediator of the effect of family history on diagnosis of any mood disorder. ResultsAll types of trauma were associated with both major depression and bipolar disorder, with the exception of sexual abuse, which was only associated with bipolar disorder. Moreover, family history of psychiatric illness was also associated with mood disorder in adulthood and with childhood trauma. Using the presence of any mood disorder as the outcome, a third of the effect of having any family history of mood disorder was mediated via childhood trauma. ConclusionThis investigation provides further support, in a population-based sample of young adults, of the association between childhood trauma and mood disorders, with sexual abuse being specifically linked with bipolar disorder.

Here, we test the hypothesis that PTSD symptom reduction during TF-CBT among adolescent girls with PTSD is associated with changes in patterns of brain functional connectivity (FC) with the amygdala during cognitive reappraisal. Method Adolescent girls with PTSD related to physical or sexual assault (n = 34) were enrolled in TF-CBT, delivered in an approximately 12-session format, in an open trial. Before and after treatment, they were engaged in a cognitive reappraisal task, probing neural mechanisms of explicit emotion regulation, during 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results Among adolescent girls completing TF-CBT with usable pre- and post-treatment scans (n = 20), improvements in self-reported emotion from pre- to post-treatment were positively related to improvements in PTSD symptoms. Adolescent girls with greater post-treatment symptom reduction were also able to suppress amygdala-insula FC while re-appraising, which was not evident in girls with less symptom reduction. Pre- to post-treatment changes in right amygdala to left insula FC that scaled with PTSD symptom reduction also scaled with improvements in emotion regulation. Conclusions These preliminary results suggest the neurocircuitry mechanisms through which TF-CBT produces clinical outcomes, providing putative brain targets for augmenting TF-CBT response.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:49:59","2018-12-21 17:49:59","","3013-3023","","14","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescence; cognitive-behavioral therapy; neuroimaging; post-traumatic stress disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because we use contextual representations to retrieve information pertaining to our past, processes that alter our representations of context can enhance or diminish our capacity to retrieve particular memories. We designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to test the hypothesis that people can intentionally forget previously experienced events by changing their mental representations of contextual information associated with those events. We had human participants study two lists of words, manipulating whether they were told to forget (or remember) the first list prior to studying the second list. We used pattern classifiers to track neural patterns that reflected contextual information associated with the first list and found that, consistent with the notion of contextual change, the activation of the first-list contextual representation was lower following a forget instruction than a remember instruction. Further, the magnitude of this neural signature of contextual change was negatively correlated with participants' abilities to later recall items from the first list.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:50:00","2018-12-21 17:50:00","","1534-1542","","5","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Context; Directed forgetting; Episodic memory; fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that knowledge of one's mind and body are related by examining metamemory and interoception. We evaluated two dimensions of metamemory and interoception: subjective beliefs and the accuracy of those beliefs compared to objective criteria. We first demonstrated, in two studies, that metamemory beliefs were positively correlated with interoceptive beliefs, and this was not due to domain-general confidence. Finally, we showed that individuals with better metamemory accuracy also had better interoceptive accuracy. Taken together, these findings suggest a common mechanism subserving knowledge of our cognitive and bodily states. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Four studies tested the hypothesis that illness schema activation leads directly and automatically to behavioral manifestations of illness. Method: Study 1 was a survey (N = 970) that evaluated the proposition that the mental representation of common cold symptom experience includes functional deviation from the usual prototypical self. Studies 2 and 3 were experiments that tested effects of cold schema activation using a subliminal priming paradigm on walking speed (Study 2, N = 53) and free recall in a memory task (Study 3, N = 30). Study 4 (N = 65) used a 2 (cold prime vs. control) = 2 (alternate self vs. control) experimental design to investigate attenuation of the effect of the cold prime on free recall. Results: Study 1 confirmed the multifactorial nature of functional self-deviations representing the common cold symptomology. Studies 2 and 3 showed that participants primed with the common cold schema walked more slowly and performed worse on a memory recall task relative to controls in whom the schema was not activated. These effects were automatic in the sense that participants were not aware of the prime or of this influence. In Study 4, priming an alternative self-identity overcame the deleterious effect of automatic common cold schema activation on free recall in a memory task. Conclusions: Subliminal activation of a schematic representation of illness automatically activates behavioral manifestations of illness.","2016-10","2018-12-21 17:50:02","2018-12-21 17:50:02","","1144-1153","","10","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","automatic behavior; common sense model; priming; schema; symptoms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A latent growth curve model was used with a sample of 75 Japanese undergraduates to test the hypothesis that anger rumination would be correlated with slopes of trait anger and anger-in over 4 months. Results indicated that anger rumination directly related to trait anger over time. Although there was no correlation between anger rumination and anger-in, anger-in was strongly covariant with trait anger over time. Moreover, compared to the low anger rumination group, the high anger rumination group was more likely to perceive a wide range of situations with frustration and to suppress anger. These results suggested that anger rumination is a potential risk factor for trait anger and anger-in. In terms of prevention, it may be clinically effective to selectively treat those with high anger rumination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore the feasibility of extending this framework to consonant manner perception, we investigated perception of the stop vs. fricative consonant contrast /b/-/v/ to test the hypothesis that young infants will display a perceptual bias grounded in the acoustic-phonetic properties of these sounds. We examined perception of stop-initial /bas/ and fricative-initial /vas/ syllables in English-learning and French-learning 5- to 6-month-olds. The /b/ and /v/ sounds distinguish words in English and French but have different distributional patterns; in spoken English /b/ occurs more frequently than /v/ whereas in spoken French /v/ occurs more frequently than /b/. A perceptual bias favoring /b/ over /v/ emerged in two experiments. In Experiment 1, a directional asymmetry was observed in discrimination; infants noticed when /vas/ changed to /bas/ but not when /bas/ changed to /vas/. In Experiment 2, a robust listening preference favoring stop-initial /bas/ was evident in responses from the same infants. This is the first study to show a perceptual bias related to consonant manner and to directly measure a consonant perception bias within the same infants. These data encourage further efforts to extend the NRV principles to perception of consonant manner. These findings indicate that we need to reform our view of infant speech perception to accommodate the fact that both discrimination abilities and biases shape speech perception during infancy.

Whereas the lesion-based record shows preferential involvement of only the left inferior frontal (LIF) cortex, associated with Broca's aphasia, during real-time comprehension of LDDs, the neuroimaging record shows additional involvement of the left posterior superior temporal (LPST) and lower parietal cortices, which are associated with Wernicke's aphasia. We test the hypothesis that this localization incongruence emerges from an interaction of memory and linguistic constraints involved in the real-time implementation of these dependencies and which had not been previously isolated. Capitalizing on along-standing psycholinguistic understanding of LDDs as the workings of an active filler, we distinguish two linguistically defined mechanisms: GAP-search, triggered by the retrieval of the relative pronoun, and GAP-completion, triggered by the retrieval of the embedded verb. Each mechanism is hypothesized to have distinct memory demands and given their distinct linguistic import, potentially distinct brain correlates. Using fMRI, we isolate the two mechanisms by analyzing their relevant sentential segments as separate events. We manipulate LDD-presence/absence and GAP-search type (direct/indirect) reflecting the absence/presence of intervening islands. Results show a direct GAP-search LIF cortex correlation that crucially excludes the LPST cortex. Notably, indirect GAP-search recruitment is confined to supplementary-motor and lower-parietal cortex indicating that GAP presence alone is not enough to engage predictive functions in the LIF cortex. Finally, GAP-completion shows recruitment implicating the dorsal pathway including: the supplementary motor cortex, left supramarginal cortex, precuneus, and anterior/dorsal cingulate. Altogether, the results are consistent with previous findings connecting GAP-search, as we define it, to the LIF cortex. They are not consistent with an involvement of the LPST cortex in any of the two mechanisms, and therefore support the view that the LPST cortex is not crucial to LDD implementation. Finally, results support neurocognitive architectures that involve the dorsal pathway in LDD resolution and that distinguish the memory commitments of the LIF cortex as sensitive to specific language-dependent constraints beyond phrase-structure building considerations.","2016-09-30","2018-12-21 17:50:05","2018-12-21 17:50:05","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attention; Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia; left inferior frontal cortex; long-distance dependencies; precuneus; sentence comprehension; supplementary motor area; working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) is a known, although still underestimated, environmental risk factor for ASD. Altered endocannabinoid activity has been observed in autistic patients, and endocannabinoids are known to modulate behavioral traits that are typically affected in ASD. On this basis, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the endocannabinoid tone contribute to the altered phenotype induced by prenatal VPA exposure in rats, with focus on behavioral features that resemble the core and associated symptoms of ASD. In the course of development, VPA-exposed rats showed early deficits in social communication and discrimination, compromised sociability and social play behavior, stereotypies and increased anxiety, thus providing preclinical proof of the long-lasting deleterious effects induced by prenatal VPA exposure. At the neurochemical level, VPA-exposed rats displayed altered phosphorylation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors in different brain areas, associated with changes in anandamide metabolism from infancy to adulthood. Interestingly, enhancing anandamide signaling through inhibition of its degradation rescued the behavioral deficits displayed by VPA-exposed rats at infancy, adolescence and adulthood. This study therefore shows that abnormalities in anandamide activity may underlie the deleterious impact of environmental risk factors on ASD-relevant behaviors and that the endocannabinoid system may represent a therapeutic target for the core and associated symptoms displayed by autistic patients.","2016-09-27","2018-12-21 17:50:07","2018-12-21 17:50:07","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Forty-two participants with bipolar I disorder were recruited during their first manic episode, pseudo-randomized to open-label lithium or quetiapine, and followed for 8 weeks. fMRI scans were obtained at baseline and then after 1 and 8 weeks of treatment, while participants performed a continuous performance task with emotional distracters.

Results: ROI data were reduced using exploratory factor analysis, which identified five factors that were organizationally consistent with functional anatomic models of human emotion modulation. Half of the participants with bipolar disorder achieved remission by Week 8 and were contrasted with the other half that did not. Analyses demonstrated that, in the bipolar disorder group in general, treatment led to decreases in activation across brain regions toward healthy subject values.

The major histocompatibility complex is consistently the most powerful region of association in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia and has been interpreted as strong genetic evidence supporting the immune hypothesis. However, global pathway analyses provide inconsistent evidence of immune involvement in schizophrenia, and it remains unclear whether genetic data support an immune etiology per se. Here we empirically test the hypothesis that variation in immune genes contributes to schizophrenia. We show that there is no enrichment of immune loci outside of the MHC region in the largest genetic study of schizophrenia conducted to date, in contrast to 5 diseases of known immune origin. Among 108 regions of the genome previously associated with schizophrenia, we identify 6 immune candidates (DPP4, HSPD1, EGR1, CLU, ESAM, NFATC3) encoding proteins with alternative, nonimmune roles in the brain. While our findings do not refute evidence that has accumulated in support of the immune hypothesis, they suggest that genetically mediated alterations in immune function may not play a major role in schizophrenia susceptibility. Instead, there may be a role for pleiotropic effects of a small number of immune genes that also regulate brain development and plasticity. Whether immune alterations drive schizophrenia progression is an important question to be addressed by future research, especially in light of the growing interest in applying immunotherapies in schizophrenia.","2016-09","2018-12-21 17:50:08","2018-12-21 17:50:08","","1176-1184","","5","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","autoimmune; genetic; immune; inflammation; inflammatory; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that English-speaking children learn their early verbs from parents' single-word utterances. Distribution of single-word transitive verbs produced by a large sample of young children was strongly predicted by the relative token frequency of verbs in parental single-word utterances, but multiword sentences had no predictive value.

Additional inclusion criteria were male sex, age 10 to 12 years or 23 to 40 years, and stimulant treatment-naive status. INTERVENTIONS Treatment with either methylphenidate or a matched placebo for 16 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in the cerebral blood flow response to an acute challenge with methylphenidate, noninvasively assessed using pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging, between baseline and 1 week after treatment. Data were analyzed using intent-to-treat analyses. RESULTS Among 131 individuals screened for eligibility, 99 patients met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD, and 50 participants were randomized to receive methylphenidate and 49 to placebo. Sixteen weeks of methylphenidate treatment increased the cerebral blood flow response to methylphenidate within the thalamus (mean difference, 6.5; 95% CI, 0.4-12.6; P = .04) of children aged 10 to 12 years old but not in adults or in the placebo group.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We confirm preclinical data and demonstrate age-dependent effects of methylphenidate treatment on human extracellular dopamine striatal-thalamic circuitry. Given its societal relevance, these data warrant replication in larger groups with longer follow-up.","2016-09","2018-12-21 17:50:10","2018-12-21 17:50:10","","955-962","","9","73","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the hypothesis that individuals recovered from anorexia nervosa would also experience greater brain activation during this task as well as higher sensitivity to salient stimuli than controls. Methods Women recovered from restricting-type anorexia nervosa and healthy control women underwent fMRI during application of a prediction error taste reward learning paradigm. Results Twenty-four women recovered from anorexia nervosa (mean age 30.3 8.1 yr) and 24 control women (mean age 27.4 6.3 yr) took part in this study. The recovered anorexia nervosa group showed greater left posterior insula activation for the prediction error model analysis than the control group (family-wise error- and small volume-corrected p < 0.05). A group x condition analysis found greater posterior insula response in women recovered from anorexia nervosa than controls for unexpected stimulus omission, but not for unexpected receipt. Sensitivity to punishment was elevated in women recovered from anorexia nervosa. Limitations This was a cross-sectional study, and the sample size was modest. Conclusion Anorexia nervosa after recovery is associated with heightened prediction error-related brain response in the posterior insula as well as greater response to unexpected reward stimulus omission. This finding, together with behaviourally increased sensitivity to punishment, could indicate that individuals recovered from anorexia nervosa are particularly responsive to punishment. The posterior insula processes somatosensory stimuli, including unexpected bodily states, and greater response could indicate altered perception or integration of unexpected or maybe unwanted bodily feelings. Whether those findings develop during the ill state or whether they are biological traits requires further study.","2016-09","2018-12-21 17:50:11","2018-12-21 17:50:11","","304-311","","5","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRNAs), which are vital fine-tuners of gene expression during the brain's response to stress, have the capacity to modulate Ucn1 expression. Methods Computational analysis revealed that the Ucn1 3 untranslated region contained a conserved binding site for miR-326. We examined miR-326 and Ucn1 levels in the EWcp of depressed suicide completers. In addition, we evaluated miR-326 and Ucn1 levels in the serum and the EWcp of a chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) rat model of behavioural despair and after recovery from CVMS, respectively. Gain and loss of miR-326 function experiments examined the regulation of Ucn1 by this miRNA in cultured midbrain neurons. Results We found reduced miR-326 levels concomitant with elevated Ucn1 levels in the EWcp of depressed suicide completers as well as in the EWcp of CVMS rats. In CVMS rats fully recovered from stress, both serum and EWcp miR-326 levels rebounded to nonstressed levels. While downregulation of miR-326 levels in primary midbrain neurons enhanced Ucn1 expression levels, miR-326 overexpression selectively reduced the levels of this neuropeptide. Limitations This study lacked experiments showing that in vivo alteration of miR-326 levels alleviate depression-like behaviours. We show only correlative data for miR-325 and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript levels in the EWcp.

However, the prospective relation between childhood NE and subsequent interrelated behavioral, emotional, and biological dysregulation in later life has not yet been established among children who experience early adversity. Using a longitudinal sample of youth who experienced parental divorce during childhood (N = 160; 53% male; 83% White), we tested the hypothesis that childhood NE would predict physiological, emotional, and behavioral dysregulation 15 years later. NE was assessed by maternal report when youth were between 9 and 12 years old. Fifteen years later, young adults (mean age = 25.55 years) participated in a psychosocial stress task to assess cortisol reactivity and reported on internalizing symptoms and problematic alcohol use. Structural equation modeling revealed that higher childhood NE predicted significantly greater alcohol use, internalizing symptoms, and total cortisol output during a stress task 15 years later. Importantly, these findings held after adjusting for childhood internalizing symptoms. In addition, problematic alcohol use was associated with greater cortisol reactivity and internalizing symptoms. Findings suggest that childhood NE is a critical risk marker for interrelated forms of dysregulation in young adulthood among at-risk youth.","2016-09","2018-12-21 17:50:12","2018-12-21 17:50:12","","877-885","","6","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol; cortisol; internalizing; negative emotionality; temperament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests the hypothesis that a nutritional supplementation of omega-3, multivitamins, and minerals over 3months, combined with cognitive behavior therapy, will reduce childhood aggression. MethodsIn this randomized, single-blind, stratified, factorial trial, a high-risk community sample of 290 children aged 11-12years were randomized into Nutrition only, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) only, Nutrition+CBT, and Control groups. The primary outcome measures of child- and parent-reported aggressive and antisocial behavior were collected at 0months (baseline), 3months (end of treatment), 6months (3months posttreatment), and 12months (9months posttreatment). The trial (Healthy Brains & Behavior: Understanding and Treating Youth Aggression (HBB)' was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov at ResultsFor child self-reports, children in the Nutrition only group showed reduced externalizing behavior compared to Controls at 3months. At 6months, the Nutrition+CBT group scored lower on externalizing behavior compared to both CBT only and Control groups. Findings were more in evidence for an Aggressive-Reactive form of antisocial behavior than for a Callous-Proactive form. Effect sizes were in the small-to-medium range (d=-.33 to -.37).

Cultural group membership significantly predicted variations in maternal sensitivity belief scores, but this effect was substantially accounted for by group variations in socio-demographic factors.

Using path analysis, we sought to test the hypothesis that exposure to adverse events produces depression and posttraumatic stress, which in turn motivate dissociation that, when at high levels, supports the use of SIB. Method: A sample of 679 adults (54% female, mean age = 53 years) were recruited from the general population by a national survey company, and administered measures evaluating posttraumatic stress, depression, dissociation, and SIB. Results: A total of 4.3% of participants reported some level of SIB within the prior 6 months. Younger age, exposure to adverse events, posttraumatic stress, depression, and dissociation were all related to SIB by univariate analyses. Path analyses revealed that although adverse events predicted posttraumatic stress and depression, which were then associated with SIB, these paths to SIB were no longer significant once dissociation was entered into the model, indicating full mediation. Conclusion: Rather than arising directly from posttraumatic stress or depression, SIB may occur most proximally in response to dissociation, with the pain associated with SIB potentially serving to interrupt or titrate unwanted hypoarousal and numbing. Clinicians should consider specifically targeting dissociation and its adversity-related antecedents when treating SIB.","2016-09","2018-12-21 17:50:16","2018-12-21 17:50:16","","618-625","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","depression; dissociation; posttraumatic stress; self-injury; self-mutilation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nurr1 is an immediate early gene, important in the brain for the stress response. We tested the hypothesis that prenatal stress and the decrease of hippocampal Nurr1 alter offspring behavioral responses in the forced swimming test (FST). Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to restraint stress (45min, thrice daily) from gestation day 14. Prenatally stressed (PS) and non-prenatally stressed (NPS) male offspring were treated bilaterally with a Nurr1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN; or control) into the hippocampus at 97d of age. After 1h, the rats were exposed to the FST (acute stressor) to analyze their behavioral responses. Thirty minutes after the FST, we analyzed the gene expression of Nurr1, Bdnf and Nr3c1 (genes for Nurr1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), respectively) in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hypothalamus. Results showed that the decrease of hippocampal Nurr1 after the antisense ODN in adult NPS rats induces immobility (indicating depressive-like behavior). The PS adult rats, including the group with decreased hippocampal Nurr1, presented low immobility in the FST. This low immobility was concordant with maintenance of Nurr1 and Bdnf expression levels in the three analyzed brain regions; Nr3c1 gene expression was also maintained in the PFC and hypothalamus. These findings suggest that Nurr1 and associated genes could participate in the brain modifications induced by prenatal stress, allowing active coping (resilience) with acute stress in adulthood.","2016-09","2018-12-21 17:50:16","2018-12-21 17:50:16","","506-515","","5","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Corticosterone; depression-like behavior; gestational stress; hippocampus; nuclear receptor; stress resilience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In each study, participants who first viewed images of meats paired with cues to pathogens subsequently reported less desire to eat those meats relative to participants in a control condition. In contrast, participants who first viewed plants paired with the same cues to pathogens did not report less desire to eat those plants. Further, a meta-analysis of effects across the three studies (total N = 398) indicated that pairings with cues to pathogens affected both desires to eat meats and anticipated tastes of meats, but not desires to eat plants or anticipated tastes of plants.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that young adult non-daily cigarette smokers' use of e-cigarettes and hookah would be positively associated with their expectancies about these products. Methods: Young adults (n = 377, 58.0% male) aged 18-24 years (M = 20.5, SD = 1.8) who had been non-daily smokers for at least six months but had never been daily smokers completed a baseline assessment online or via mobile phone as part of a larger, longitudinal study. Results: Approximately one in three participants reported any e-cigarette (34.0%) and/or hookah (33.4%) use in the past 14 days; 37% of those who used either product reported using both. More positive e-cigarette expectancies were associated with higher odds of any e-cigarette use and with heavier use in the past two weeks. Similarly, more positive expectancies for hookah use predicted greater odds of any use as well as more frequent use of hookah (all ps < 0.001). Cigarette expectancies were correlated with ANTP expectancies, but did not account for the latter's association with ANTP use. Conclusions: Findings suggest that expectancies play a role in determining whether young adult cigarette smokers also use these nicotine products. These data also suggest use of e-cigarettes and/or hookah may be as common as not among young adult nondaily smokers.

Methods: Combinatorial algorithms, latent profile analysis, and repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance were employed to characterize heterogeneity and depression outcome-measure profile variability in the most prevalent symptom combinations with full data (26% of baseline and 13% of endpoint total sample). Results: Descriptive results suggest that substantial heterogeneity and moderate coherence characterize major depressive disorder; as in previous analyses, pairs of individuals sharing no symptoms in common were observed. Exploratory latent profile analysis indicated that different patterns of treatment outcome data exist among STAR*D participants. A small but significant interaction effect of symptom combination x outcome measure profile was observed for clinician-rated but not self-reported symptom combinations. Limitations: Factors moderating the generalizability of these findings include binary symptom measures, a short treatment period, and a smaller number of individuals per combination. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that citalopram treatment outcomes vary as a function of diagnostic combinations, thereby providing preliminary evidence that the substantial heterogeneity documented in depression symptom presentations may carry implications for prognosis and treatment outcome. At the level of descriptive phenomenology, these results appear to corroborate the claim that depression is not a homogenous syndrome. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, few fMRI studies have compared regional brain activity and connectivity in different mood states in bipolar disorder to determine if manic symptomatology is reflected in specific circuit abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that bipolar mania is associated with altered connectivity between cortical regions thought to regulate subcortical structures such as the amygdala and striatum. Methods: 28 subjects with bipolar disorder in a manic state, 24 different bipolar subjects in a euthymic state, and 23 matched healthy comparison subjects underwent resting state fMRI scans. Several cortical and sub-cortical structures implicated in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder were selected for study. We conducted a whole-brain analysis of functional connectivity of these regions. Results: Bipolar mania was differentiated from euthymia by decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Mania was also characterized by increased connectivity between amygdala and dorsal frontal cortical structures that are normally anti-correlated in emotion regulation tasks. Limitations: Both groups of bipolar subjects were prescribed medications. The study was not longitudinal in design. Conclusions: Compared to bipolar subjects in a euthymic state, subjects in the manic state demonstrate disrupted functional connectivity between brain regions involved in the regulation of emotion and the amygdala. This disruption of activity in neural circuits involved in emotion may underlie the emotional dysregulation inherent to a bipolar manic episode. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In a key manipulation, gambles for oneself or for another were for either small or large rewards. We tested the hypothesis that value affects the neural response to self-gamble outcomes, but not other-gamble outcomes. Our experimental data revealed that while participants learned the correct response option for both self and other gambles, the reward positivity evoked by wins was impacted by value only when gambling for oneself.

Alterations of RNA editing on the serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) pre-mRNA in the brain of suicides produce transcripts that attenuate 5-HT2CR signaling by impairing intracellular G-protein coupling and subsequent intracellular signal transduction. In brain, the distribution of RNA-editing enzymes catalyzing deamination (A-to-I modification) shows regional variation, including within the cerebral cortex. We tested the hypothesis that altered pre-mRNA 5-HT2CR receptor editing in suicide is region-specific. To this end, we investigated the complete 5-HT2CR mRNA-editing profile in two architectonically distinct cortical areas involved in mood regulation and decision-making in a clinically well-characterized cohort of age-and sex-matched non-psychiatric drug-free controls and depressed suicides. By using an original biochemical detection method, that is, capillary electrophoresis single-stranded conformational polymorphism (CE-SSCP), we corroborated the 5-HT2CR mRNA-editing profile previously described in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9 (BA9)). Editing of 5-HT2CR mRNA displayed clear regional difference when comparing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24). Compared with non-psychiatric control individuals, alterations of editing levels of 5-HT2CR mRNA were detected in both cortical areas of depressed suicides. A marked increase in editing on 5-HT2CR was especially observed in the anterior cingulate cortex in suicides, implicating this cortical area in suicide risk. The results suggest that region-specific changes in RNA editing of 5-HT2CR mRNA and deficient receptor function likely contribute to the etiology of major depressive disorder or suicide.","2016-08-30","2018-12-21 17:50:22","2018-12-21 17:50:22","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, patients with these psychiatric disorders tend to perceive that they received the affectionless control parenting, which is a combination of lack of care and overprotection. To test the hypothesis that the affectionless control parenting impairs the formation of positive working models, we examined the effects of perceived parenting styles on qualities of working models. The subjects were 691 healthy Japanese volunteers. Working models of the self and other were assessed by the Relationship Scales Questionnaire. Perceived parental rearing was evaluated by the Parental Bonding Instrument, which has the care and protection subscales. Parental rearing was classified into one of the four types defined by combinations of levels of care and protection. In all combinations of recipient sexes and parental sexes, the subjects with the affectionless control parenting (low care/high protection) had lower scores of the self-model and other-model than those with the optimal parenting (high care/low protection).

We specifically tested the hypothesis that implicit self-esteem would influence depression-related memory biases via its association with explicit self-esteem. Self-esteem was assessed in patients with a current Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; n=38) and in a control group of participants who had never experienced depression (ND; n=40) by using explicit (Rosenberg Self-esteem Questionnaire) and implicit (Go/No-go Association Task) measures. A self -referent processing task of negative and positive adjectives was used to assess memory bias. Our analyses revealed that participants diagnosed with MDD showed lower levels of both explicit and implicit self-esteem in comparison to ND participants. MDD compared to ND participants also recalled a greater number of depressed self referent adjectives and lower recall of positive self -referent information. Mediation analyses showed an indirect effect of explicit self-esteem on the relationship between implicit self-esteem and depression related memory biases in the MDD group. These findings suggest an association between implicit and explicit self-esteem in depression that may result in negative cognitive processing, as reflected by self referent memory biases.

The current study tests the hypothesis that maladaptive interpersonal schemas (MIS) are characteristic of BPD, but not of the major mood disorders. One hundred psychiatric inpatients were assessed by SCID I, SCID II and the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-S2). Logistic regression analyses tested the association between MIS (measured by the YSQ-S2) and BPD, bipolar, major depressive and schizoaffective disorder. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses assessed the sensitivity and specificity of MIS as a marker of BPD. After covariation for comorbidity with each of the 3 mood disorders, BPD was robustly associated with 4 out of 5 schema domains. In contrast, only one of fifteen regression analyses demonstrated a significant association between any mood disorder and schema domain after covariation for comorbid BPD. ROC analyses of the 5 schema domains suggested Disconnection/Rejection had the greatest power for identification of BPD cases. These data support the specific role of maladaptive interpersonal schemas in BPD and potentially contribute to greater conceptual clarity about the distinction between BPD and the major mood disorders.

Among humans, tests of this hypothesis have yielded mixed results. This study tests the hypothesis using data collected among contemporary peasants in Central South China. We use current family status (rated by our informants) and father's former class identity (assigned by the Chinese Communist Party in the early 1950s) as measures of parental status, and proportion of sons in offspring and offspring's years of education as measures of parental investment. Results show that (i) those families with a higher former class identity such as landlord and rich peasant tend to have a higher socioeconomic status currently, (ii) high-status parents are more likely to have sons than daughters among their biological offspring, and (iii) in higher-status families, the years of education obtained by sons exceed that obtained by daughters to a larger extent than in lower-status families. Thus, the first assumption and the two predictions of the hypothesis are supported by this study.

The kynurenine pathway is involved in neuroinflammation and regulates glutamate neurotransmission. In the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of suicidal patients, levels of inflammatory cytokines and the kynurenine metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist, are increased. The enzyme amino-beta-carboxymuconate-semialdehyde-decarboxylase (ACMSD) limits QUIN formation by competitive production of the neuroprotective metabolite picolinic acid (PIC). Therefore, decreased ACMSD activity can lead to excess QUIN. We tested the hypothesis that deficient ACMSD activity underlies suicidal behavior. We measured PIC and QUIN in CSF and plasma samples from 137 patients exhibiting suicidal behavior and 71 healthy controls. We used DSM-IV and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Suicide Assessment Scale to assess behavioral changes. Finally, we genotyped ACMSD tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 77 of the patients and 150 population-based controls. Suicide attempters had reduced PIC and a decreased PIC/QUIN ratio in both CSF (P<0.001) and blood (P=0.001 and P<0.01, respectively). The reductions of PIC in CSF were sustained over 2 years after the suicide attempt based on repeated measures. The minor C allele of the ACMSD SNP rs2121337 was more prevalent in suicide attempters and associated with increased CSF QUIN. Taken together, our data suggest that increased QUIN levels may result from reduced activity of ACMSD in suicidal subjects. We conclude that measures of kynurenine metabolites can be explored as biomarkers of suicide risk, and that ACMSD is a potential therapeutic target in suicidal behavior.","2016-08-02","2018-12-21 17:50:25","2018-12-21 17:50:25","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adolescents with CD often show a generalised pattern of deficits, while those with ADs show hypersensitivity to specific negative emotions. Although these conditions often cooccur, little is known regarding emotion recognition performance in comorbid CD+ADs. Here, we test the hypothesis that in the comorbid case, anxiety-related emotion hypersensitivity counteracts the emotion recognition deficits typically observed in CD. Method: We compared facial emotion recognition across four groups of adolescents aged 12-18 years: those with CD alone (n = 28), ADs alone (n = 23), cooccurring CD+ADs (n = 20) and typically developing controls (n = 28). The emotion recognition task we used systematically manipulated the emotional intensity of facial expressions as well as fixation location (eye, nose or mouth region). Results: Conduct disorder was associated with a generalised impairment in emotion recognition; however, this may have been modulated by group differences in IQ. AD was associated with increased sensitivity to low-intensity happiness, disgust and sadness. In general, the comorbid CD+ADs group performed similarly to typically developing controls. Conclusions: Although CD alone was associated with emotion recognition impairments, ADs and comorbid CD+ADs were associated with normal or enhanced emotion recognition performance. The presence of comorbid ADs appeared to counteract the effects of CD, suggesting a potentially protective role, although future research should examine the contribution of IQ and gender to these effects.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:26","2018-12-21 17:50:26","","917-926","","8","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anxiety disorder; callous-unemotional traits; comorbidity; Conduct disorder; emotion recognition; response biases; social information processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Decreases in both emotion regulation problems (mediated effect: ab =.36), and fear of intense emotions (mediated effect: ab =.24) were found to be complementary mediators of reductions in PTSD symptoms greater with SAT.

Furthermore, we predicted that this priming effect would be related to functional connectivity within neural networks mediating religious cognition, decision-making, reward valuing, and prospection processes. Contrary to past research with young adults, we found a significant positive relationship between religiosity and discounting rates. Religious semantic primes did not reliably shift individual discounting rates. But religious controls did respond more quickly to intertemporal decisions under the religious priming condition than the neutral condition, compared to response time differences among the participants with PD. Differences in response time were significantly associated with functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and various regions, including the left anterior cingulate cortex and Brodmann areas 10 and 46 in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Although theory suggests that individuals vary characteristically in what situations may activate their personality dynamics, there has been a paucity of studies investigating broad personality traits in relation to ego depletion. Conscientiousness, which represents an individual's ability to control one's impulses and persevere towards goal-directed behavior, is a trait within the Five Factor Model comprised of six lower facets with particular relevance to ego depletion. The present study tests the hypothesis that state depletion impacts the links between conscientiousness traits and behavioral disinhibition. In a sample of 214 undergraduates who underwent an experimental ego depletion paradigm, results suggest that ego depletion moderates the effect of domain level conscientiousness, as well as facet level self-discipline and deliberation, on food choice. This finding indicates individuals high in trait self-control may be specifically activated by state ego depletion, allowing for individuals high on these traits to persist in making less dysregulated choices after being depleted.

Method: Veterans (N = 130) who served as part of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan completed a diagnostic assessment of PTSD, a battery of questionnaires assessing coping style, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and quality of life, and neuropsychological tests measuring attention, learning and memory, working memory, inhibition, executive control, and visual motor coordination. Results: Executive control, immediate and delayed verbal recall, and visual motor coordination were associated with quality of life. However, after controlling for the effects of combat exposure, PTSD, and probable TBI, no measure of neuropsychological functioning was directly associated with quality of life. Mediation analyses indicated that delayed verbal recall influenced quality of life through its effect on action- focused coping. Conclusions: Although replication is needed, these findings indicate that delayed verbal recall may indirectly influence quality of life among Iraq/Afghanistan veterans through its association with action- focused coping strategies. Psychologists who are working with veterans that are experiencing memory difficulties and poor quality of life may consider focusing on improving coping skills prior to rehabilitation of memory deficits.

However, not much is known regarding its association with self-knowledge in terms of bodily aspects, and the combinations by which these two aspects are used to enhance authentic living. Based on a salutogenic perspective, the current study examined whether emotional clarity and body awareness are associated. Further, we tested the hypothesis that these constructs contribute to authentic behavior through the moderation of mindfulness. 341 university students completed questionnaires assessing body awareness, emotional clarity, mindfulness, and authentic behavior. The findings indicated that body awareness and emotional clarity are moderately correlated. SEM analysis revealed that emotional clarity was correlated with authentic behavior, and that mindfulness moderated the association between body awareness and authentic behavior. Further, a two-factor model for authentic behavior was generated; intrapersonal-authenticity and interpersonal-authenticity. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that while emotional clarity was associated with both factors, body awareness was only associated with interpersonal-authenticity, through the moderation of mindfulness. Mindfulness further mediated the association between emotional clarity and interpersonal-authenticity.

On this basis, Study 2 used a leader sample and investigated the relationship between leaders' dispositional mindfulness and actual servant leadership behaviors as perceived by their followers. The findings revealed that leaders' dispositional mindfulness was positively related to direct reports' ratings of the servant leadership dimensions humility, standing back, and authenticity.

Disrupting individuals' facial action, for example, interferes with verbal emotion recognition tasks. We tested the hypothesis that facial responses also play a functional role in the perceptual processing of emotional expressions. We altered the facial action of participants with a gel facemask while they performed a task that involved distinguishing target expressions from highly similar distractors. Relative to control participants, participants in the facemask condition demonstrated inferior perceptual discrimination of facial expressions, but not of nonface stimuli. The findings suggest that somatosensory/motor processes involving the face contribute to the visual perceptual-and not just conceptual-processing of facial expressions. More broadly, our study contributes to growing evidence for the fundamentally interactive nature of the perceptual inputs from different sensory modalities.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:32","2018-12-21 17:50:32","","1150-1156","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cross-modal effects; Face perception; Facial expressions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some have claimed that the broad and rapid change in estimation patterns that occurs with corrective feedback provides strong evidence for this shift. However, quantitative models of proportion judgment may provide a better account of children's estimation patterns while also predicting broad and rapid change following feedback. Here we test the hypothesis that local corrective feedback provides children with additional reference points, rather than catalyzing a shift to a different mental representation of number. We tested 117 children from several second-grade classrooms in a number-line feedback study. Data indicate that the proportion-judgment framework accounts for individual differences in estimation patterns, and that the effects of feedback are consistent with the unique quantitative predictions of the framework. They do not provide evidence supporting the representational shift hypothesis or, more broadly, for the proposal that cognitive change can occur rapidly at the level of entire mental representations.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:32","2018-12-21 17:50:32","","1198-1205","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive development; Mathematical cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A prominent theory holds that the reward positivity reflects a reward prediction error signal that is sensitive to outcome valence, being larger for unexpected positive events relative to unexpected negative events (Holroyd & Coles, 2002). Although the theory has found substantial empirical support, most of these studies have utilized either monetary or performance feedback to test the hypothesis. However, in apparent contradiction to the theory, a recent study found that unexpected physical punishments also elicit the reward positivity (Talmi, Atkinson, & El-Deredy, 2013). The authors of this report argued that the reward positivity reflects a salience prediction error rather than a reward prediction error. To investigate this finding further, in the present study participants navigated a virtual T maze and received feedback on each trial under two conditions. In a reward condition, the feedback indicated that they would either receive a monetary reward or not and in a punishment condition the feedback indicated that they would receive a small shock or not. We found that the feedback stimuli elicited a typical reward positivity in the reward condition and an apparently delayed reward positivity in the punishment condition. Importantly, this signal was more positive to the stimuli that predicted the omission of a possible punishment relative to stimuli that predicted a forthcoming punishment, which is inconsistent with the salience hypothesis.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:33","2018-12-21 17:50:33","","1185-1192","","8","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","EEG; Reinforcement learning; Reward positivity; Reward prediction error; Salience prediction error","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assumed that road accidents of military drivers that participated in this research will be related to their traffic violations as well as to their level of discipline. We further assumed that military drivers with low education will commit more discipline violations, more traffic violation and therefore will be involved in more road accidents. Method: Drivers' records and crash data, usually collected as a routine by the army, were obtained from a unique linked database for 300 professional drivers in the Israeli military services enlisted in 2005 and 2006. The data related to drivers were randomly sampled from the data base. Our dependent variables were involvement in accidents and traffic offences while our independent variables were traffic offences, quality group (QG) and discipline offences as a measure for general behavior. Statistical analyzes were performed on the data in order to test the hypotheses. Results: In the group of high QG drivers that committed more discipline offences were more probable to make an accident. However, for the low QG drivers this association has been found as mediated by traffic violations. On the whole, drivers with low QG were involved in more accidents. Conclusions: The quality of a person in terms education, psychometric tests and personality tests (as defined by the army) is associated with more traffic accidents. Additionally, in the group of high quality, discipline offences are associated with more traffic accidents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, subsequent manual response times (RTs) have revealed additive effects, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that an interaction for RTs is obscured by preceding multisaccade trajectories, promoted by the continuous presence of distractors in the display. In two experiments, we compared a condition in which distractors were removed soon after the presentation of the search display to a standard condition in which distractors were not removed.

This can be explained by differences in number morphology, but it can also be explained by many other differences between the languages and the environments of the children who were compared. The present study tests the hypothesis that the morphological singular/plural distinction supports the early acquisition of the meaning of the number word for one by comparing young English learners to age and SES matched young Mandarin Chinese learners. Mandarin does not have obligatory number morphology but is more similar to English than Japanese in many crucial respects. Corpus analyses show that, compared to English learners, Mandarin learners hear number words more frequently, are more likely to hear number words followed by a noun, and are more likely to hear number words in contexts where they denote a cardinal value. Two tasks show that, despite these advantages, Mandarin learners learn the meaning of the number word for one three to six months later than do English learners. These results provide the strongest evidence to date that prior knowledge of the numerical meaning of the distinction between singular and plural supports the acquisition of the meaning of the number word for one.

This paper seeks to explain conflicting results with MTFC by testing the hypotheses that it benefits antisocial young people more than others and does so through its effects on their behaviour. Hard-to-manage young people in English foster or residential homes were assessed at entry to a randomised and case-controlled trial of MTFC (n = 88) and usual care (TAU) (n = 83). Primary outcome was the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) at 12 months analysed according to high (n = 112) or low (n = 59) baseline level of antisocial behaviour on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents. After adjusting for covariates, there was no overall treatment effect on CGAS. However, the High Antisocial Group receiving MTFC gained more on the CGAS than the Low group (mean improvement 9.36 points vs. 5.33 points). This difference remained significant (p < 0.05) after adjusting for propensity and covariates and was statistically explained by the reduced antisocial behaviour ratings in MTFC. These analyses support the use of MTFC for youth in public care but only for those with higher levels of antisocial behaviour. Further work is needed on whether such benefits persist, and on possible negative effects of this treatment for those with low antisocial behaviour.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:36","2018-12-21 17:50:36","","843-852","","8","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Antisocial behaviour; Conduct disorder; Controlled trial; MTFC; TFCO-A; Treatment interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often used in medication-resistant schizophrenia patients when pharmacologic interventions have failed; however, the mechanism of action is unclear. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are reduced in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia and are increased by antipsychotic treatment. We tested the hypothesis that ECT increases serum BDNF levels by measuring BDNF concentrations in schizophrenia patients before and after they received ECT. Methods: A total of 160 patients with schizophrenia were examined. The ECT group (n = 80) was treated with antipsychotics and ECT (eight to 10 sessions administered every other day). The drug therapy group (n = 80) received only antipsychotic treatment. A control group (n = 77) was recruited that served as the baseline for comparison. Results: Baseline serum BDNF level in ECT group was lower than in controls (9.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 12.4 +/- 3.2 ng/ml; P < 0.001), but increased after ECT, such that there was no difference between the two groups (11.9 +/- 3.3 vs. 12.4 +/- 3.2 ng/ml; P = 0.362). There was no correlation between patients' Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score and serum BDNF level before ECT; however, a negative correlation was observed after ECT (total: r = -0.692; P < 0.01). From baseline to remission after ECT, serum BDNF level increased (P < 0.001) and their PANSS score decreased (P < 0.001). Changes in BDNF level (2.21 +/- 4.10 ng/ml) and PANSS score (28.69 +/- 14.96) were positively correlated in the ECT group (r = 0.630; P < 0.01). Conclusions: BDNF level was lower in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy controls before ECT and medication. BDNF level increased after ECT and medication, and its longitudinal change was associated with changes in patients' psychotic symptoms. These results indicate that BDNF mediates the antipsychotic effects of ECT.

A number of human randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on this topic were conducted but not systematically analysed since 2005. Objects: A meta-analysis was undertaken to test the hypothesis of non-inferiority of remote psychiatric counseling, including both assessment and treatment, compared to face-to-face setting. Focus of research was the general psychiatric approach, which includes pharmacotherapy, counseling and some not specific psychotherapeutic techniques such as listening, reformulation and clarification among others. Specific forms of psychotherapies were not included in this analysis. Design: RCTs including >= 10 subjects per arm were identified in Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase and the reference list of single papers. A random-effect and a mixed-effect model served for test the hypothesis under analysis. Results: Twenty-six RCTs were included in the analysis, involving 765 (assessment) and 1585 patients (efficacy). The non-inferiority of remote psychiatric counseling was reported both for assessment and treatment. Heterogeneity could not be excluded for assessment, but was excluded for treatment while taking into account clinical and study related variables (P-values = 0.003 and 0.06, respectively). Conclusion: High levels of consistency between remote and in vivo psychiatric assessment is reported. Efficacy of remote psychiatric counseling was shown to be not inferior compared to in vivo settings. Heterogeneity could not be excluded for assessment, and further analyses are mandatory.

A separate research line suggests that lesbians are, on average, more masculine than straight women in their nonsexual behaviors and characteristics. Hence, a common influence could affect the expression of male-typical sexual and nonsexual traits in some women. By integrating these research programs, we tested the hypothesis that male-typical sexual arousal of lesbians relates to their nonsexual masculinity. Moreover, the most masculine-behaving lesbians, in particular, could show the most male-typical sexual responses. Across combined data, Study 1 examined these patterns in women's genital arousal and self-reports of masculine and feminine behaviors. Study 2 examined these patterns with another measure of sexual arousal, pupil dilation to sexual stimuli, and with observer-rated masculinity-femininity in addition to self-reported masculinity-femininity. Although both studies confirmed that lesbians were more male-typical in their sexual arousal and nonsexual characteristics, on average, there were no indications that these 2 patterns were in any way connected. Thus, women's sexual responses and nonsexual traits might be masculinized by independent factors.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:39","2018-12-21 17:50:39","","265-283","","2","111","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","masculinity-femininity; sex-typed behavior; sexual arousal; sexual orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of all staff and students aged 18-40 at 37 UK higher educational institutions in 2010, and identified 3432 respondents who had experienced a sudden bereavement of a close contact since reaching the age of 10, either due to sudden natural causes, sudden unnatural causes, or suicide. We used multivariable regression to compare scores on the stigma, shame, responsibility and guilt subscales of the Grief Experience Questionnaire, adjusting for socio-demographic factors and pre-bereavement psychopathology. Results: People bereaved by suicide (n = 614) had higher stigma scores than people bereaved by sudden natural death (n = 2106; adjusted coefficient = 2.52; 95% CI = 2.13-2.90; p = <0.001) and people bereaved by sudden unnatural death (n = 712; adjusted coefficient = 1.69; 95% CI = 125-2.13; p = <0.001). Shame, responsibility and guilt scores were also significantly higher in people bereaved by suicide, whether compared with bereavement by sudden natural death or sudden unnatural death. Associations were not modified by whether the bereaved was blood-related to the deceased or not. Conclusions: Stigma was perceived more acutely by the relatives and friends of those who died by suicide than those bereaved by other causes of sudden natural or sudden unnatural death. Their high levels of perceived stigma, shame, responsibility and guilt require qualitative investigation to identify whether these grief dimensions limit social functioning, help-seeking behaviour and/or support offered.

This study tested the hypothesis that combined effects of a dopamine and noradrenergic agonist, d-methylphenidate extended-release (DMPH) with guanfacine (GUAN), an alpha(2A) receptor agonist, would be clinically superior to either monotherapy and would have equal tolerability. Method: An 8-week, double-blind, 3-arm, comparative trial randomized 7- to 14-year-olds with DSM-IV ADHD to GUAN (1-3 mg/day), DMPH (5-20 mg/day), or a combination (COMB) with fixed-flexible dosing. Outcome measures were the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) and the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) scale. Data on adverse events and safety measures were obtained. Results: A total of 207 participants were randomized and received drug.

Recent evidence indicates that this effect is increased by sadness in a task involving neutral stimuli. We tested the hypothesis that such effect may not be limited to negative emotions but reflect a general depletion of attentional resources by examining whether a positive emotion (happiness) would increase deviance distraction too. Prior to performing an auditory-visual oddball task, happiness or a neutral mood was induced in participants by means of the exposure to music and the recollection of an autobiographical event. Results from the oddball task showed significantly larger deviance distraction following the induction of happiness. Interestingly, the small amount of distraction typically observed on the standard trial following a deviant trial (post-deviance distraction) was not increased by happiness. We speculate that happiness might interfere with the disengagement of attention from the deviant sound back towards the target stimulus (through the depletion of cognitive resources and/or mind wandering) but help subsequent cognitive control to recover from distraction.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:41","2018-12-21 17:50:41","","419-433","","3","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","deviance distraction; induced happiness; neutral stimuli; oddball task; post-deviance distraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Study 1, the validity of a reading comprehension scale was evaluated using the Rasch model with 60 students with learning disabilities (LD). Item parameters were retested for the presence of anxiety and results indicated that the scale was substantially more difficult in its presence. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 using maladaptive motivation and extended with inclusion of adaptive motivational variables in order to reverse the effect. Results using students with and without LD indicated that the difficulty levels of the scale was lower for students with LD, in the presence of positive motivation, compared with a typical student group. Study 3 extended the dichotomous hierarchical generalized linear model with polytomous data. The measures of an ability test were adjusted for the presence of anxiety and results indicated that differential item functioning was observed at both the global level and the most difficult ability item. It is concluded that the difficulty levels of a scale are heavily influenced by situational factors during testing, such as students' entry levels of motivation and affect.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:42","2018-12-21 17:50:42","","638-661","","4","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anxiety; assessment; hierarchical generalized linear modeling; identification; motivation; polytomous data; Rasch model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to test a social-cognitive model of parental exercise participation over a 12-month period. Mothers (n = 226) and fathers (n = 70) of children < 16 completed measures of exercise, barriers self-efficacy, perceived barriers, and exercise planning at baseline and 1 year later. Panel analyses were used to test the hypothesized relationships. Barriers self-efficacy was related to exercise directly and indirectly through perceived barriers and prioritization/planning. Prioritization and planning also mediated the relationship between perceived barriers and exercise. These paths remained significant at 12 months. These results suggest efforts to increase exercise in parents should focus on improving confidence to overcome exercise barriers, reducing perceptions of barriers, and helping parents make specific plans for prioritizing and engaging in exercise.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:42","2018-12-21 17:50:42","","599-609","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Barriers; Fathers; Mothers; Physical activity; Self-efficacy; Self-regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is no research on the correlates of this practice in romantic relationships or on the processes mediating its effects. Building on self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, ), three studies tested the hypothesis that perceived CPR impairs relationship quality, partly because it undermines the fulfillment of the basic psychological needs for autonomy and relatedness. Study 1 (N = 125) examined perceived CPR and relationship quality across four relationship targets: mother, father, romantic partner, and best friend. Study 2, involving romantic partners (N = 142), examined whether needs fulfillment mediated the association between perceived CPR and relationship quality. Study 3, involving romantic dyads (N = 85), also included partner reports on CPR. Across the three studies, CPR was linked with poor relationship quality between relationships, between people, and between dyadic partners. Moreover, results of Study 2 and Study 3 revealed that the inverse association between perceived CPR and relationship quality was mediated by dissatisfaction of autonomy but not relatedness. Despite its seemingly benign nature, CPR is detrimental to relationship quality, partly because it thwarts the basic need for autonomy.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:43","2018-12-21 17:50:43","","446-460","","4","84","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been identified as a contributory cause of paranoia, but any causal relationship with hallucinations has yet to be established. We tested the hypotheses that insomnia i) has a cross-sectional association with hallucinations ii) predicts new inceptions of hallucinations and iii) that these associations remain after controlling for depression, anxiety, and paranoia. Data from the second (2000, N=8580) and third (2007, N=7403) British Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys were used to assess cross-sectional associations between insomnia and hallucinations. The 2000 dataset included an 18 month follow up of a subsample (N=2406) used to test whether insomnia predicted new inceptions of hallucinations. Insomnia was associated with hallucinations in both cross-sectional datasets. Mild sleep problems were associated with 2-3 times greater odds of reporting hallucinations, whilst chronic insomnia was associated with four times greater odds. Insomnia was also associated with increased odds of hallucinations occurring de novo over the next 18 months. These associations remained significant, although with smaller odds ratios, after controlling for depression, anxiety and paranoia. This is the first longitudinal evidence that insomnia is associated with the development of hallucinatory experiences. Effective treatment of insomnia may lessen the occurrence of hallucinations.

We investigated sleep habits related to sleep quality including sleep duration, daytime nap duration, nap frequency, and dream content recall frequency (DCRF). Declarative working memory can be subdivided into verbal working memory (VWM) and visuospatial working memory (VSWM). We hypothesized that sleep habits would have different effects on VWM and VSWM. To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate differences between VWM and VSWM related to daytime nap duration, nap frequency, and DCRF. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the effects of duration and frequency of daytime naps and DCRF on VWM and VSWM differed according to sex. We assessed 779 healthy right-handed individuals (434 males and 345 females; mean age: 20.7 +/- 1.8 years) using a digit span forward and backward VWM task, a forward and backward VSWM task, and sleep habits scales. A correlation analysis was used to test the relationships between VWM capacity (VWMC) and VSWM capacity (VSWMC) scores and sleep duration, nap duration, nap frequency, and DCRF. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with VWMC and VSWMC scores and to identify sex-related differences. We found significant positive correlations between VSWMC and nap duration and DCRF, and between VWMC and sleep duration in all subjects. Furthermore, we found that working memory capacity (WMC) was positively correlated with nap duration in males and with sleep duration in females, and DCRF was positively correlated with VSWMC in females. Our finding of sex-related differences in the effects of sleep habits on WMC has not been reported previously. The associations between WMC and sleep habits differed according to sex because of differences in the underlying neural correlates of VWM and VSWM, and effectiveness of the sleep habits in males and females.","2016-07-28","2018-12-21 17:50:45","2018-12-21 17:50:45","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","dream content remembering frequency (DCRF); nap duration; sleep duration; verbal working memory capacity (VWMC); visuospatial working memory capacity (VSWMC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although loneliness is strongly associated with psychosis, its relationship with psychosis proneness is unclear. Our aim in this paper was to test the hypothesis that loneliness and schizotypal traits, conveying risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, are similar but separate constructs. Pooling data from two non-clinical student samples (N = 551) we modeled the structure of the relationship between loneliness and trait schizotypy. Loneliness was assessed with the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3), whilst negative (Social Anhedonia) and positive (Perceptual Aberrations) schizotypal traits were assessed with the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales-Brief (WSS-B). Fit statistics indicated that the best fitting model of UCLA-3 scores comprises three correlated factors (Isolation, Related Connectedness, and Collective Connectedness), consistent with previous reports. Fit statistics for a two factor model of positive and negative schizotypy were excellent. Next, bi-factor analysis was used to model a general psychopatholgy factor (p) across the three loneliness factors and separate negative and positive schizotypy traits. The results showed that all items (except 1) co-loaded on p. However, with the influence of p removed, additional variance remained within separate sub-factors, indicating that loneliness and negative and positive trait schizotypy are distinct and separable constructs. Similarly, once shared variance with p was removed, correlations between sub-factors of loneliness and schizotypal traits were non-significant. These findings have important clinical implications since they suggest that loneliness should not be conflated with the expression of schizotypy. Rather, loneliness needs to be specifically targeted for assessment and treatment in youth at risk for psychosis.","2016-07-07","2018-12-21 17:50:46","2018-12-21 17:50:46","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bi-factor model; loneliness; psychopathology; psychosis continuum; schizotypal traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This GAD67 deficit is accompanied by lower cortical levels of other GABA-associated transcripts, including GABA transporter-1, PV, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin receptor kinase B, somatostatin, GABA A receptor a1 subunit, and KCNS3 potassium channel subunit mRNAs. In contrast, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), another enzyme for GABA synthesis, are not altered. We tested the hypothesis that this pattern of GABA-associated transcript levels is secondary to the GAD67 deficit in PV neurons by analyzing cortical levels of these GABA-associated mRNAs in mice with a PV neuron-specific GAD67 knockout. Using in situ hybridization, we found that none of the examined GABA-associated transcripts had lower cortical expression in the knockout mice. In contrast, PV, BDNF, KCNS3, and GAD65 mRNA levels were higher in the homozygous mice. In addition, our behavioral test battery failed to detect a change in sensorimotor gating or working memory, although the homozygous mice exhibited increased spontaneous activities. These findings suggest that reduced GAD67 expression in PV neurons is not an upstream cause of the lower levels of GABA-associated transcripts, or of the characteristic behaviors, in schizophrenia. In PV neuron- specific GAD67 knockout mice, increased levels of PV, BDNF, and KCNS3 mRNAs might be the consequence of increased neuronal activity secondary to lower GABA synthesis, whereas increased GAD65 mRNA might represent a compensatory response to increase GABA synthesis.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:47","2018-12-21 17:50:47","","992-1002","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cerebral cortex; in situ hybridization; mouse; prepulse inhibition; schizophrenia; working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The theory makes predictions that are tested against data, not fitted to it. The experiments use a no-choice/choice utility learning paradigm where the no-choice phase is used to elicit a profile of each participant's performance across the strategy space and the choice phase is used to test predicted choices within this space. They show that the majority of individuals select strategies that are boundedly optimal. Further, individual differences in what people choose to do are successfully predicted by the analysis. Two issues are discussed: (a) the performance of the minority of participants who did not find boundedly optimal adaptations, and (b) the possibility that individuals anticipate what, with practice, will become a bounded optimal strategy, rather than what is boundedly optimal during training.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:47","2018-12-21 17:50:47","","1192-1223","","5","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptation; Bounded optimality; Bounded rationality; Constraints; Utility maximization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Observational and cross-sectional multicenter study. The sample consisted of patients with AD recruited in outpatient consultation offices by a convenience sampling procedure stratified by dementia severity. Cognitive and functional status, behavioral disturbances, dependence level, medical comorbidities, and caregiver burden were assessed by using standardized instruments. A path analysis was used to test the hypothesized relationships between the caregiver burden and its determinants, including the level of dependence. Results: The sample consisted of 306 patients (33.3% mild, 35.9% moderate, 30.7% severe), the mean age was 78.5 years (SD = 7.8), and 66.2% were women. The model fit was acceptable and explained 29% of the caregiver burden variance. Primary stressors were the level of dependence and the distress related to behavioral disturbances. Caregiver's age, gender, and co-residence with the patient were the contextual factors related to caregiver burden. The job status of the caregiver was a significant secondary stressor, functional disability was indirectly associated with caregiver burden via dependence, and frequency of behavioral disturbances was indirectly associated with the caregiver burden via distress. Conclusions: Dependence was, apart from behavioral disturbances, the most important primary stressor directly related to caregiver burden irrespective of the disease severity.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:48","2018-12-21 17:50:48","","1133-1141","","7","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alzheimer's disease; caregiver burden; dementia; dependence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First-year students (N = 354) rated their ITV and ASC of ability regarding four school subjects and four unknown fields of study, which were differentially related in content to the school subjects. Structural equation modeling revealed that school-subject ITV predicted field-of-study ITV that had been rated to be similar.

Whereas vasopressin synthesized and released within the hypothalamus is primarily involved in endocrine regulation, vasopressin signaling in other brain areas may contribute to anxiety- and depression-like behavioral parameters.

The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that salivary cortisol and cardiovascular responses to real-life psychosocial stressors related to public performance can cross-adapt with responses to psychosocial stress induced by public speech under laboratory setting. The sample consisted of 22 healthy male volunteers, which were either actors, more precisely students of dramatic arts or non-actors, students of other fields. The stress task consisted of 15min anticipatory preparation phase and 15min of public speech on an emotionally charged topic. The actors, who were accustomed to public speaking, responded with a rise in salivary cortisol as well as blood pressure to laboratory public speech. The values of salivary cortisol, systolic blood pressure and state anxiety were lower in actors compared to non-actors. Unlike non-actors, subjects with experience in public speaking did not show stress-induced rise in the heart rate. Evaluation of personality traits revealed that actors scored significantly higher in extraversion than the subjects in the non-actor group. In conclusion, neuroendocrine responses to real-life stressors in actors can partially cross-adapt with responses to psychosocial stress under laboratory setting.

We test how the three tangibility dimensions influence perceived diagnosticity and, eventually, online purchase intentions.

The results showed that out of these formats, virtual mirrors were superior in providing a sense of product tangibility, followed by the 360-spin rotation format and static pictures. Furthermore, in terms of predictive validity, two of the three tangibility dimensions significantly increased perceived diagnosticity, which, in turn, positively and strongly affected purchase intentions. Overall, our results add to previous works studying the relationships between online product presentation formats and consumer decision making.

However, visual stimuli have been shown to improve memory for older adults by decreasing false memories. This suggests that older adults may be immune to recognition-induced forgetting and that recognition practice may decrease susceptibility to intrusion errors. We first tested the hypothesis that older adults are immune to recognition-induced forgetting. We found older adults exhibit recognition-induced forgetting. Next, we tested the hypothesis that recognition practice decreases older adult's rates of intrusion errors. We found lower intrusion errors for novel objects from practiced categories.

Most of the offenders had behaviours associated with personality disorder, although had not necessarily received a diagnosis of personality disorder. AimsTo evaluate this service (the intervention) and test the hypothesis that its work would be associated with a reduction in recalls to prison. MethodsLocal and national probation records were used to identify all prison recalls made by 10 consistently available probation officers for 1year before the intervention and up to 3years after its introduction; reasons for recall and evidence of new arrests or charges were also extracted. ResultsThere was a significant decrease in rate of recalls in the first year of the intervention, sustained over the second year and, for the smaller number of officers still available, also over the third year. Non-compliance with supervision as a reason for recall was cut by two-thirds; other reductions were in responses to challenging' behaviours. There was no evidence of increase in serious further offending. ConclusionsOur findings provide preliminary evidence that psychologically informed practice by probation officers supervising offenders at highest risk of serious harm re-offending can reduce the rate of recall to prison, a costly alternative to maintaining offenders in the community, without apparently reducing community safety. Further research should clarify the extent to which the intervention helped the officers merely to tolerate challenging behaviours from these offenders and the extent of real change in the behaviours.

Eye tracking objectively assesses eye-gaze behaviour in response to visual stimuli, which permits inference about underlying cognitive processes. We tested the hypothesis that social orienting in infancy is altered by preterm birth. Methods: Fifty preterm infants with mean (range) gestational age (GA) at birth of 29(+1) (23(+2)-33(+0)) weeks and 50 term infants with mean (range) GA at birth 40(+2) (37(+0)-42(+3)) weeks underwent eye tracking at median age of 7 months. Infants were presented with three categories of social stimuli of increasing complexity. Time to first fixate (TFF) and looking time (LT) on areas of interest (AoIs) were recorded using remote eye tracking. Results: Preterm infants consistently fixated for a shorter time on social content than term infants across all three tasks: face-scanning (fixation to eyes minus mouth 0.61s vs. 1.47s, p = .013); face pop-out task (fixation to face 0.8s vs. 1.34s, p = .023); and social preferential looking (1.16s vs. 1.5s p = .02). Time given to AoIs containing social content as a proportion of LT at the whole stimulus was lower in preterm infants across all three tasks. These results were not explained by differences in overall looking time between the groups. Conclusions: Eye tracking provides early evidence of atypical cognition after preterm birth, and may be a useful tool for stratifying infants at risk of impairment for early interventions designed to improve outcome.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:53","2018-12-21 17:50:53","","861-868","","7","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","development; eye tracking; preterm infant; Social orienting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Participants are 420 older persons from 2 clinical-pathologic studies without cognitive impairment at study onset. They completed a battery of 17 cognitive tests annually for a minimum of 5 years, died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify neuronal neurofibrillary tangles and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology and to identify Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis. The authors used sigmoid mixed models based on the 4-parameter logistic distribution to decompose nonlinear global cognitive trajectories into components and assess the relation of each neuropathologic marker to each trajectory component. Results: Cognitive function was assessed for a mean of 10.5 years before death. In the absence of pathology, global cognition was relatively stable before declining moderately in the last 3 to 4 years of life. Tangles were related to all trajectory components except initial level. TDP-43 pathology was the only marker related to initial level of function. It was also associated with an earlier midpoint of decline but not to slope of decline. Hippocampal sclerosis was related to an earlier midpoint of decline and more rapid slope of decline. Lewy bodies were associated with faster slope of decline and lower level of function proximate to death. Conclusion: Neurodegenerative processes are differentially related to cognitive trajectories, with TDP-43 pathology most potently impacting incipient cognitive decline, AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis affecting the progression of cognitive decline, and Lewy bodies impacting terminal decline.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:54","2018-12-21 17:50:54","","591-599","","5, SI","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive decline; hippocampal sclerosis; longitudinal study; neurofibrillary tangles; TDP-43 pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some research suggests that the tendency to experience shame, but not guilt, contributes to aggression in individuals with a history of interpersonal trauma. This study tested the hypothesis that trait shame but not trauma-related guilt would mediate the relationship between PTSD symptoms and verbal and physical aggression in veterans with combat/military-related trauma seeking PTSD treatment. Method: In a sample of 127 returning veterans (95% male, mean age = 32.93), negative binomial path analyses tested multiple mediational models in which shame versus trauma-related guilt (separate models entered the effects of global guilt, guilt cognitions, and guilt distress) were examined as mediators of PTSD symptoms on verbal and physical aggression separately. Results: Results indicated that shame partially mediated the association of PTSD symptoms with verbal aggression but not physical aggression when accounting for trauma-related guilt. Although PTSD symptoms were associated with higher scores on all aspects of trauma-related guilt, guilt did not significantly mediate relations between PTSD symptoms and verbal or physical aggression when accounting for shame. Conclusion: These results indicate that it is worthwhile to examine whether addressing shame in PTSD treatment may also reduce verbal aggression in returning veterans.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:54","2018-12-21 17:50:54","","520-527","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aggression; guilt; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); shame; veterans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: In a multicenter trial, we randomized 570 CAD patients scoring higher than 7 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale to usual care plus either one information session (UC-IS) or stepwise psychotherapy (UC-PT). UC-PT patients received three individual psychotherapy sessions. Those still depressed were offered group psychotherapy (25 sessions).

In particular, the research tests the hypothesis that ingroup ties are a stronger predictor of self-stereotyping among people from individualist cultures than among people from collectivist cultures. In Study 1, university students (N=117) completed measures of ingroup ties and self-stereotyping with respect to an intimacy group (family and friends). Consistent with predictions, ingroup ties significantly predicted self-stereotyping among individualists but not among collectivists. Study 2 (N=104) found a similar pattern of results among members of the global internet community who considered either an intimacy group (their friends), a task group (their work group) or a social category (their gender). These results indicate that people in individualist cultures are more likely than those in collectivist cultures to base their social identities on ingroup ties. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to self-categorization theory's depersonalization account of social identification.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:55","2018-12-21 17:50:55","","225-234","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cross-cultural; ingroup identification; ingroup ties; self-categorization theory; self-stereotyping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because depressive illness is recurrent, recurrence prevention should be a mainstay for reducing its burden on society. One way to reach this goal is to identify malleable risk factors. The ability to attenuate sadness/dysphoria (mood repair) and parasympathetic nervous system functioning, indexed as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), are impaired during depression and after it has remitted. The present study therefore tested the hypothesis that these two constructs also may mirror risk factors for a recurrent major depressive episode (MDE). Method. At time 1 (T1), 178 adolescents, whose last MDE had remitted, and their parents, reported on depression and mood repair; youths' RSA at rest and in response to sad mood induction also were assessed. MDE recurrence was monitored until time 2 (T2) up to 2 years later. Mood repair at T1 (modeled as a latent construct), and resting RSA and RSA response to sadness induction (RSA profile), served to predict onset of first recurrent MDE by T2. Results. Consistent with expectations, maladaptive mood repair predicted recurrent MDE, above and beyond T1 depression symptoms. Further, atypical RSA profiles at T1 were associated with high levels of maladaptive mood repair, which, in turn, predicted increased risk of recurrent MDE. Thus, maladaptive mood repair mediated the effects of atypical RSA on risk of MDE recurrence. Conclusions. This study documented that a combination of behavioral and physiological risk factors predicted MDE recurrence in a previously clinically referred sample of adolescents with depression histories. Because mood repair and RSA are malleable, both could be targeted for modification to reduce the risk of recurrent depression in youths.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:57","2018-12-21 17:50:57","","2109-2119","","10","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescents; emotion regulation; mood repair; recurrent major depression; respiratory sinus arrhythmia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MethodNeuropsychological function was assessed in 30 depressed patients with MDD and 34 control participants. Cognitive composites were derived from a minimum of three tests and included attention, executive function, visuospatial memory and verbal memory. A multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess group differences in overall cognitive performance, and multiple regression models were used to evaluate the role of attention in deficits in other domains. ResultsThe cognitive deficit in the depressed sample was found to be characterized by poorer performance in attention and executive function. When evaluating the interrelationship between the two deficits, the attentional deficit was found to persist when variability in executive function was statistically accounted for, whilst the executive deficit was eliminated when attention was accounted for. ConclusionThe results demonstrated that the attentional deficit could not be explained by deficits in executive function, which provides support for a primary attention deficit in depression.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:50:57","2018-12-21 17:50:57","","73-82","","1","134","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affective disorders; cognitive functioning; depression; neurocognition; neuropsychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cognitive models suggest that negative cognitions, including interpretation bias, play a role in etiology and maintenance of depression. Given that cognitive development is incomplete by the teenage years and that CBT is not superior to non-cognitive treatments in the treatment of adolescent depression, it is important to test the underlying model. The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that interpretation biases are exhibited by depressed adolescents. Four groups of adolescents were recruited: clinically-referred depressed (n = 27), clinically-referred non-depressed (n = 24), community with elevated depression symptoms (n = 42) and healthy community (n = 150). Participants completed a 20 item ambiguous scenarios questionnaire. Clinically-referred depressed adolescents made significantly more negative interpretations and rated scenarios as less pleasant than all other groups.

The clinical profiles of highly anxious Internet checkers, and the relationship to checking behavior itself have not previously been reported. Objective: In this article, we test the hypothesis, derived from cognitive-behavioral models, that individuals with higher levels of illness anxiety would recall having experienced worsening anxiety after reassurance-seeking on the Internet. Method: Data from 731 volunteers who endorsed engaging in online symptom-searching were collected using an online questionnaire. Severity of health anxiety was assessed with the Whiteley Index, functional impairment with the Sheehan Disability Scale, and distress recall during and after searching with a modified version of the Clinician's Global Impairment scale. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine variables contributing to distress during and after Internet checking. Results: Severity of illness anxiety on the Whiteley Index was the strongest predictor of increase in anxiety associated with, and consequent to, online symptom-searching. Individuals with high illness anxiety recalled feeling worse after online symptom-checking, whereas those with low illness anxiety recalled relief Longer-duration online health-related use was associated with increased functional impairment, less education, and increased anxiety during and after checking. Conclusion: Because individuals with moderate-high levels of illness anxiety recall experiencing more anxiety during and after searching, such searching may be detrimental to their health. If replicated in controlled experimental settings, this would suggest that individuals with illness anxiety should be advised to avoid using the Internet for illness related information.","2016-08","2018-12-21 17:50:59","2018-12-21 17:50:59","","390-400","","4","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cyberchondria; functional impairment; health anxiety; hypochondriasis; illness anxiety; internet symptom-searching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One promising candidate for such a linking mechanism is disturbance in the sense of self. This paper tests the hypothesis that disturbances in the sense of self mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality pathology. Specifically, we assess the self-related traits of stable self-image, self-reflective functioning, self-respect and feeling recognized. Methods: The sample included 113 non-psychotic psychiatric inpatients. Participants completed the Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 (PDQ-4+), and the self-reflexive functioning, stable self image, self-respect, and feeling recognized scales from the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118). A series of linear regressions was then performed to assess the direct and indirect effects of childhood trauma on personality disorder traits (PDQ-4+ total score), as mediated by self concept (SIPP-118 scales). Aroian tests assessed the statistical significance of each mediating effect. Results: There was a significant mediating effect for all SIPP self concept variables, with a full mediating effect for the SIPP composite score and for SIPP feeling recognized and self-reflexive functioning, such that the direct effect of childhood trauma on personality did not retain significance after accounting for the effect of these variables. There was a partial mediating effect for SIPP stable self image and self-respect, such that the direct effect of the CTQ retained significance after accounting for these variables. SIPP feeling recognized had the strongest mediating effect. Conclusions: Multiple facets of self concept, particularly the degree to which an individual feels understood by other people, may mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult personality pathology. This underscores the importance of attending to disturbances in the sense of self in patients with personality pathology and a history of childhood maltreatment. These findings also support the centrality of disturbed self concept to the general construct of personality pathology.

Design: We hypothesized that job demands would be positively related to workaholism, particularly when job resources are low. In addition, we hypothesized that workaholism would be positively related to negative outcomes in three important life domains: health, family, and work. Methods: The research involved 617 Italian workers (employees and self-employed). To test the hypotheses we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) and moderated structural equation modeling (MSEM) using Mplus 6. Results: The results of SEM showed a good model where workload, cognitive demands, emotional demands, and customer-related social stressors were positively related to workaholism and work-family conflict (WFC) (partial mediation). Additionally, workaholism was indirectly related to exhaustion and intentions to change jobs through WFC. Moreover, MSEM analyses confirmed that job resources (job security and opportunities for development) buffered the relationship between job demands and workaholism. Particularly, the interaction effects were statistically significant in five out of eight combinations. Conclusions: These findings suggest that workaholism is a function of a suboptimal work environment and predicts unfavorable employee outcomes. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","2016-07","2018-12-21 17:51:00","2018-12-21 17:51:00","","400-414","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","job demands; Job demands-resources model; job resources; work-family conflict; workaholism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When no information about numerical risk estimates is available (e.g., probability of loss or magnitude of consequences), people may rely on positive and negative affect toward perceived risk. However, determinants of affective reactions to risks are poorly understood. In a series of three experiments, we addressed the question of whether and to what degree mental imagery eliciting negative affect and stress influences risk perception. In each experiment, participants were instructed to visualize consequences of risk taking and to rate riskiness. In Experiment 1, participants who imagined negative risk consequences reported more negative affect and perceived risk as higher compared to the control condition. In Experiment 2, we found that this effect was driven by affect elicited by mental imagery rather than its vividness and intensity. In this study, imagining positive risk consequences led to lower perceived risk than visualizing negative risk consequences. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that negative affect related to higher perceived risk was caused by negative feelings of stress.

However, existing research has focused mainly on the consequences of benevolent leadership, and research probing into its antecedents is scarce. To fill such research gap, the current study aims to explore the effect of the congruence between implicit positive followership prototype (PFP) and explicit positive followership trait (PFT) on benevolent leadership. Polynomial regression combined with the response surface methodology was used to test the hypotheses herein. The results, based on a sample of 241 leader follower dyads from four Chinese family firms, indicated the following: (1) benevolent leadership is higher when leader PFP is congruent with follower PFT than when they are incongruent; (2) in cases of congruence, benevolent leadership is higher when leader PFP and follower PFT are both high rather than low; (3) in the case of incongruence, there is no significant difference for the level of benevolent leadership in two scenarios: “low leader PFP - high follower PFT” and “high leader PFP - low follower PFT”.","2016-06-07","2018-12-21 17:51:02","2018-12-21 17:51:02","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","benevolent leadership; implicit followership theory; polynomial regression; positive followership prototype; positive followership trait","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, perceived control should be enhanced if there is a large contrast between one's own control and the control that the context itself seems to exert over events. Given that depression is associated with low perceived control, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced attentional focus to context will increase perceived control in people with and without depression. A total of 106 non-depressed and mildly depressed participants completed a no control zero-contingency task with low and high outcome probability conditions. In the experimental context-focus group, participants were instructed to attend to the context, whereas in the control group, participants were instructed to attend to their thoughts. Irrespective of attentional focus, non-depressed participants displayed illusory control. However, people with mild depression responded strongly to the attention focus manipulation. In the control group, they evidenced low perceived control with classic depressive realism effects. In the experimental group, when asked to focus on the context in which events took place, participants with mild depression displayed enhanced perceived control or illusory control, similar to non-depressed participants. Findings are discussed in relation to whether depression effects on perceived control represent tendencies towards realism or attentional aspects of depressive thoughts.","2016-06-02","2018-12-21 17:51:02","2018-12-21 17:51:02","","1073-1081","","6","69","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention; Context; Contingency learning; Depression; Depressive realism; Perceived control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research is therefore needed to maximize the impact of mentoring for at-risk youth who might struggle to benefit from mentoring relationships. This study tested the hypothesis that different types of youth risk would have a negative impact on mentoring relationship quality and duration and explored whether mentor characteristics exacerbated or mitigated these negative effects. Results showed that elevated environmental stress at a youth's home and/or school predicted shorter match duration, and elevated rates of youth behavioral problems, such as poor academic performance or misconduct, predicted greater youth dissatisfaction and less positive mentor perceptions of relationship quality. Mentors with greater self-efficacy and more previous involvement with youth in their communities were able to buffer the negative effects of environmental stress on match duration. Similarly, mentors' previous involvement with youth buffered the negative effects of youth behavioral problems on mentor perceptions of relationship quality.

According to social-cognitive theories of the CRE, processes of categorization and individuation at encoding account for differential recognition of same-and cross-race faces. Recent face memory research has suggested that similar but distinct categorization and individuation processes also occur postencoding, at recognition. Using a divided-attention paradigm, in Experiments 1A and 1B we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that distinct postencoding categorization and individuation processes occur during the recognition of same-and cross-race faces. Specifically, postencoding configural divided-attention tasks impaired recognition accuracy more for same-race than for cross-race faces; on the other hand, for White (but not Black) participants, postencoding featural divided-attention tasks impaired recognition accuracy more for cross-race than for same-race faces. A social categorization paradigm used in Experiments 2A and 2B tested the hypothesis that the postencoding ingroup or out-group social orientation to faces affects categorization and individuation processes during the recognition of same-race and cross-race faces. Postencoding out-group orientation to faces resulted in categorization for White but not for Black participants. This was evidenced by White participants' impaired recognition accuracy for same-race but not for cross-race out-group faces. Postencoding in-group orientation to faces had no effect on recognition accuracy for either samerace or cross-race faces. The results of Experiments 2A and 2B suggest that this social orientation facilitates White but not Black participants' individuation and categorization processes at recognition. Models of recognition memory for same-race and cross-race faces need to account for processing differences that occur at both encoding and recognition.","2016-06","2018-12-21 17:51:04","2018-12-21 17:51:04","","771-780","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cross-race effect; Eyewitness memory; Face recognition memory; Own-race bias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were 120 pregnant women recruited for a larger, longitudinal study investigating the role of psychosocial and environmental risk on women and their young children. Data were collected during the third trimester of pregnancy, and when children were 1 and 2 years of age. Participants completed a projective test designed to elicit individual differences in perceptions of infant emotions and an observer-rated assessment of parenting behaviors was conducted in the family home. Using structural equation modeling, we tested associations between maternal interpersonal aggression exposure and perceptions of infant emotion and parenting behaviors. Results demonstrated that a history of child abuse and intimate partner conflict were associated with a maternal tendency to view ambiguous infant facial expressions as negative (i.e., negative attribution bias), and in turn, with less parenting sensitivity over time. Findings suggest that negative attributions of infant emotion may be 1 mechanism by which a history of trauma and violence exposure contributes to less sensitive parenting for some mothers. Implications for intervention include the need for trauma-informed clinical services and psychoeducational methods that help mothers more accurately read and respond to infant emotional expression and bids for connection.","2016-06","2018-12-21 17:51:05","2018-12-21 17:51:05","","436-448","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","child maltreatment; early parenting; infant emotion; interpersonal aggression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hyperactivity is a core feature of both disorders, but severely disturbed sleep and circadian dysregulation are more characteristic of BD, at least in adults. We tested the hypothesis that objective measures of activity, sleep, and circadian rhythms would help differentiate pediatric subjects with BD from ADHD and typically developing controls. Methods: Unmedicated youths (N = 155, 97 males, age 5-18) were diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria with Kiddie-SADS PL/E. BD youths (n = 48) were compared to typically developing controls (n = 42) and children with ADHD (n = 44) or ADHD plus comorbid depressive disorders (n = 21). Three-to-five days of minute-to-minute belt-worn actigraph data (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc.), collected during the school week, were processed to yield 28 metrics per subject, and assessed for group differences with analysis of covariance. Cross-validated machine learning algorithms were used to determine the predictive accuracy of a four-parameter model, with measures reflecting sleep, hyperactivity, and circadian dysregulation, plus Indic's bipolar vulnerability index (VI). Results: There were prominent group differences in several activity measures, notably mean 5 lowest hours of activity, skewness of diurnal activity, relative circadian amplitude, and VI. A predictive support vector machine model discriminated bipolar from non-bipolar with mean accuracy of 83.1 +/- 5.4%, ROC area of 0.781 +/- 0.071, kappa of 0.587 +/- 0.136, specificity of 91.7 +/- 5.3%, and sensitivity of 64.4 +/- 13.6%. Conclusions: Objective measures of sleep, circadian rhythmicity, and hyperactivity were abnormal in BD. Wearable sensor technology may provide bio-behavioral markers that can help differentiate children with BD from ADHD and healthy controls.","2016-06","2018-12-21 17:51:06","2018-12-21 17:51:06","","706-716","","6","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Actigraphy; ADHD; bipolar disorder; child; circadian rhythms; sleep","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that a different belief of parentstheir failure mind-setsmay be more visible to children and therefore more prominent in shaping their beliefs.

Study 2 probed more deeply into how parents display failure mind-sets. In Study 3a, we found that children can indeed accurately perceive their parents' failure mind-sets but not their parents' intelligence mind-sets. Study 3b showed that children's perceptions of their parents' failure mind-sets also predicted their own intelligence mind-sets. Finally, Study 4 showed a causal effect of parents' failure mind-sets on their responses to their children's hypothetical failure.

Method: Participants were from a prospective longitudinal study of emotion development. Preschoolers 3-5 years of age were originally ascertained from primary care and day care sites in the St. Louis area and then underwent annual behavioral assessments for up to 12 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with a history of depression symptoms underwent neuroimaging at school age. Using functional MRI, the authors examined whole brain resting-state functional connectivity with the left and right hippocampus and amygdala. Results: Lower income-to-needs ratio at preschool age was associated with reduced connectivity between hippocampus and amygdala and a number of regions at school age, including the superior frontal cortex, lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate, and putamen. Lower income-to-needs ratio predicted greater negative mood/depression severity at school age, as did connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right superior frontal cortex and between the right amygdala and the right lingual gyrus. Connectivity mediated the relationship between income to-needs ratio and negative mood/depression at the time of scanning.

We sought to evaluate cognitive performance among children with either BD type I, II, or “not otherwise specified” (NOS) participating in multi-site Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth study compared to typically developing controls (TDC) without psychopathology. In particular, we sought to test the hypothesis that BD-I and BD-II youths with full threshold episodes of mania or hypomania would have cognitive deficits, including in reversal learning, vs. those BD-NOS participants with sub-threshold episodes and TDCs. N = 175 participants (BD-I = 81, BD-II = 11, BD-NOS = 28, TDC = 55) completed Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Testing Battery (CANTAB) tasks. A priori analyses of the simple reversal stage of the CANTAB intra-/extra-dimensional shift task showed that aggregated BD-I/II participants required significantly more trials to complete the task than either BD-NOS participants with sub-syndromal manic/hypomanic symptoms or than TDCs. BD participants across sub-types had impairments in sustained attention and information processing for emotionally valenced words. Our results align with prior findings showing that BD-I/II youths with distinct episodes have specific alterations in reversal learning. More broadly, our study suggests that further work is necessary to see the interaction between neurocognitive performance and longitudinal illness course.

This study tested the hypothesis that parenting behaviours, including parental warmth, anger, consistency and self-efficacy, are related to adolescents' academic performance and mastery, and that this relationship is mediated by adolescent boys' and girls' perceptions of parenting and their sense of school membership in different ways. Multi-group nested structural equation models were built using the data obtained from Wave 5 of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Four measures of parenting behaviours, adolescents' perception of parenting behaviour, adolescents' sense of school membership and their academic performance and mastery were obtained from 1926 boys and 1850 girls and their parents to test this study's hypotheses. The path models showed that girls' perceptions of parenting played a more explicit role in affecting their academic performance and mastery compared to boys. Furthermore, parenting behaviours were mediated by boys' and girls' sense of school membership, as influenced by their perceptions of parenting, in predicting their mastery and performance orientations, though the effects were quite different. The results suggest the roles played by parents in contributing to their children's schooling and academic performance somewhat differ between boys and girls.","2016-06","2018-12-21 17:51:13","2018-12-21 17:51:13","","2021-2033","","6","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Academic performance and mastery; Adolescence perceptions; Mediation; Parenting behaviours; School membership","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, past research has typically neglected (a) the bidimensionality of the Self-Monitoring Scale and (b) the hierarchical nature of personality. The objective of this study was to test hypotheses that the two self-monitoring factors are located at the level of the metatraits. Using data from two large multi-informant samples, one community (Sample 1: N=552, M-age=51.26, 61% female; N-Peers=1,551, M-age=48.61, 37% female) and one online (Sample 2: N=3,726, M-age=24.89, 59% female; N-Peers=17,868, M-age=26.23, 64% female), confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Results confirmed hypotheses that acquisitive self-monitoring would have a strong positive relation to metatrait Plasticity, whereas protective self-monitoring would have a moderate negative relation to metatrait Stability. In both samples, constraining the correlation between acquisitive self-monitoring and Plasticity to unity did not alter model fit indices, indicating that the two putatively distinct constructs are identical. Findings have wide-ranging implications, including integration of the construct of self-monitoring into the mainstream of personality research, as the latter moves toward the development of broad explanatory theories.","2016-06","2018-12-21 17:51:14","2018-12-21 17:51:14","","335-347","","3","84","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This effect has been explained in terms of narcissists' motivation to reduce the discrepancy between their grandiose self and its threatened version, though no research has directly tested this hypothesis. If this notion is true, the link between narcissism and retaliatory aggression should be moderated by neural structures that subserve discrepancy detection, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). This study tested the hypothesis that narcissism would only predict greater retaliatory aggression in response to social rejection when the dACC was recruited by the threat. Thirty participants (15 females; M-age=18.86, SD=1.25; 77% White) completed a trait narcissism inventory, were socially accepted and then rejected while undergoing fMRI, and then could behave aggressively toward one of the rejecters by blasting him or her with unpleasant noise. When narcissists displayed greater dACC activation during rejection, they behaved aggressively. But there was only a weak or nonsignificant relation between narcissism and aggression among participants with a blunted dACC response. Narcissism's role in aggressive retaliation to interpersonal threats is likely determined by the extent to which the brain's discrepancy detector registers the newly created gap between the grandiose and threatened selves.","2016-06","2018-12-21 17:51:14","2018-12-21 17:51:14","","361-368","","3","84","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two distinct studies reported here first test the hypothesis that, supposing that IQ and postformal thought tap into some similar cognitive operations, individuals would use some similar patterns of responses in showing both intelligence and reported postformal operations. The participants in this research were two separate samples of 41 emerging adult undergraduate students from Towson University who chose to sign up through the research pool website. In the first study materials consisted of a consent form, demographic questionnaire, a use of postformal thought survey, and the WASI abbreviated test. In the second study a pretest and posttest reported motivation survey were added. In the first study no significant relations were found between the reported use of postformal thought and the WASI IQ scores. In the second study there was a significant correlation between motivation and intelligence and between motivation and an individual's reported level of postformal thought. However, there was no significant relationship found between postformal thought and intelligence, even with motivation controlled.

However, risky decisions can vary in the amount of ambiguity about the likelihood of each outcome occurring. The current study tested the hypothesis that the amount of ambiguity in risky-decisions would moderate the relationship between risk taking and anxiety. In this study, participants completed individual difference measures and then a version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) with either high or low ambiguity about the likelihood of a negative outcome. As hypothesized, higher levels of anxiety predicted less risk taking in the high ambiguity version of the BART, but anxiety and risk taking were unrelated to one another in the low ambiguity version. This study demonstrates that in order to understand the relationship between anxiety and risk taking, ambiguity level must be taken into account. Furthermore, this finding provides support for cognitive models of anxiety suggesting that anxious individuals interpret negative outcomes as more likely to occur than less anxious individuals.

However, the interpretation of these concomitant effects requires a better understanding of dopamine's role in attention processing. Here we test the hypotheses that D-2/D-3 receptors (D-2/D3R) in dorsal and ventral striatum would distinctly regulate the activation of attention regions and that, by decreasing D-2/D-3, SD would disrupt these associations. We measured striatal D-2/D3R using positron emission tomography with [C-11] raclopride and brain activation to a visual attention (VA) task using 4-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging. Fourteen healthy men were studied during rested wakefulness and also during SD. Increased D-2/D3R in striatum (caudate, putamen and ventral striatum) were linearly associated with higher thalamic activation. Subjects with higher D-2/D3R in caudate relative to ventral striatum had higher activation in superior parietal cortex and ventral precuneus, and those with higher D-2/D3R in putamen relative to ventral striatum had higher activation in anterior cingulate. SD impaired the association between striatal D-2/D3R and VA-induced thalamic activation, which is essential for alertness. Findings suggest a robust DAergic modulation of cortical activation during the VA task, such that D-2/D3R in dorsal striatum counterbalanced the stimulatory influence of D-2/D3R in ventral striatum, which was not significantly disrupted by SD. In contrast, SD disrupted thalamic activation, which did not show counterbalanced DAergic modulation but a positive association with D-2/D3R in both dorsal and ventral striatum. The counterbalanced dorsal versus ventral striatal DAergic modulation of VA activation mirrors similar findings during sensorimotor processing (Tomasi et al., 2015) suggesting a bidirectional influence in signaling between the dorsal caudate and putamen and the ventral striatum.","2016-05-31","2018-12-21 17:51:17","2018-12-21 17:51:17","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the Stereotype Content Model we tested the hypothesis that passive and active forms of help would be associated with increased and decreased expression of schizotypy, respectively. Schizotypal traits were assessed in students (N=631) using positive (Perceptual Aberration) and negative (Social Anhedonia) subscales of the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales-Brief. Experiences of active (intentional) and passive (less deliberative) harm and help were assessed with the Behaviour from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes Treatment Scale. As predicted, the results showed that experiences of passive help from others were associated with a 2-3 fold increase in scores on schizotypy scales, whilst reports of active help tended to be associated with a decrease in scores on these scales. Results also showed that increased reports of active and passive harm were associated with elevated scores on negative and positive schizotypy subscales, consistent with prior research. These findings, bridging research on social stereotyping and schizotypal personality, challenge the assumption that helpful behaviour from others is always beneficial for individuals with schizotypal traits who are at increased risk for psychosis.

We hypothesized that maladaptive metacognitive beliefs at baseline were associated with baseline subjective cognitive impairments, that they predict subjective cognitive impairments at treatment termination, and that a reduction in maladaptive metacognitive beliefs was associated with less subjective cognitive impairments at treatment termination, independent of changes in fatigue, pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Methods: In this non-controlled study, patients (n = 137) on sick leave due to chronic fatigue received a 3.5-week inpatient RTW rehabilitation program. Of these patients 69 (50.4%) was referred with a ICPC-2 diagnosis of chronic fatigue. Patients completed questionnaires about metacognitive beliefs, somatic complaints, psychological complaints, and cognitive impairments before and after treatment. To test the hypotheses we performed paired t-tests of change, as well as seven hierarchical linear regressions. Results: Results showed that baseline maladaptive metacognitive beliefs were significantly associated with subjective cognitive impairments at baseline, controlling for symptoms. Score on baseline metacognitive beliefs did not predict impairments post-treatment. Testing specific maladaptive beliefs, pre-treatment scores on cognitive confidence were associated with subjective cognitive impairments both pre and post-treatment, controlling for symptoms. Post-treatment metacognitive beliefs and post-treatment cognitive confidence were associated with post-treatment subjective cognitive impairments, controlling for pre-treatment impairments and pre-treatment metacognitive beliefs, as well as pre and post scores on symptom measures. Conclusion: This study reports associations between maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and subjective cognitive impairments in patients with chronic fatigue. Targeting metacognitive beliefs could prove an effective therapeutic intervention for subjective cognitive impairments in these patients.","2016-05-13","2018-12-21 17:51:18","2018-12-21 17:51:18","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attention; chronic fatigue; memory; metacognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We attempted to validate these proposed domains in a large sample of patients with major depression. Methods - Participants from five treatment studies received a SCID assessment interview to assess DSM-5 personality disorder symptoms. Personality disorder symptoms were assigned to the five proposed domains. Confirmatory factor analysis in an exploratory framework was used to test the hypothesized domain structure. Results - A total of 606 patients were included in the analysis. A series of models were tested on the data set. The best fitting model produced five domains. Three domains detached, anankastic and negative affective were similar to the ICD-11 proposed domains. The Disinhibited domain did not emerge as a distinct factor but loaded onto a single Dissocial/Disinhibited factor. The model was improved by adding a separate Antisocial domain. The remaining domain incorporating borderline, histrionic and narcissistic symptoms is tentatively labelled Borderline to retain continuity with clinical practice and research. Conclusions - The proposed ICD-11 personality disorder domains were partially validated. We have five domains currently labelled Detached, Anankastic, Negative Emotional, Antisocial and Borderline. The sample studied limits the generalizability of our findings. In particular, the broad domain we have called Borderline requires further study.

Methods: 330 adult patients with MDD (DSM-5) and positive for either MTHFR C677T or A1298C polymorphism were enrolled in a trial conducted between August 1, 2014, and April 3, 2015. 160 patients received placebo, while 170 received a capsule containing a combination of reduced B vitamins. Plasma homocysteine levels were measured at baseline and week 8. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to evaluate efficacy for MDD. Results: 159 of 170 vitamin-treated patients and 123 of 160 placebo-treated patients were completers. Of the active treatment group, 131 (82.4%) showed a reduction in homocysteine (for a mean in this subgroup of 25%, P < .001), while 28 (17.6%) showed no significant change. Placebo patients demonstrated a small elevation in homocysteine. Active-treatment patients demonstrated, on average, a 12-point reduction on the MADRS by week 8, and 42% achieved full remission (P < .001). No side effect was significantly different between groups. No patients experienced mania. Conclusions: A combination of reduced B vitamins and micronutrients, when used in the treatment of MDD in patients with MTHFR polymorphism, resulted in a separation from placebo by week 2, and 42% of the treatment arm achieved remission by week 8. Further, clinical improvement correlated with a significant reduction in homocysteine levels in a majority of responders. These results support the homocysteine theory of depression and the safety and therapeutic benefit of reduced B vitamins as monotherapy for MDD, particularly in patients with MTHFR polymorphism.

Participants received fake comparative social feedback that their ability to tolerate painful stimulations was either very poor or outstanding after which they performed an unrelated go/no-go task. Participants receiving low-tolerance feedback, relative to high-tolerance feedback, were less successful at inhibiting their responses and more influenced by previous trial conditions, as indicated by an increased slowdown following errors and more failed inhibitions following go-trials. These observations demonstrate a shift from a more proactive to a more reactive control mode. This study shows that providing feedback about one's own capacity to control impulsive reactions to painful stimulations directly influences low-level cognitive control dynamics.

Areas of structural difference were used as a region of interest to evaluate the implications that structural abnormalities found in the ADHD group might have on working memory function. There was lower grey matter volume bilaterally in adolescence ADHD participants in the caudate (p < 0.05 FWE corrected across the whole brain) at age 20-24. Working memory was poorer in adolescence ADHD participants, with associated failure to show normal load-dependent caudate activation. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in adolescence have structural and functional deficits in the caudate associated with abnormal working memory function.

We also observed a significant diagnosis by age interaction for the node degree of the right anterior insula, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.

It is thought to demonstrate reactive control of word-reading processes. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that using explicit, trial-by-trial congruency precues to proactively guide attention during a color-word Stroop task could reduce the otherwise robust ISPC effect. In Experiment 1, the precueing manipulation was employed alongside a manipulation traditionally thought to influence proactive control of word-reading processes (i.e., list proportion congruence [list PC]). Precueing participants with 100 %-valid precues eliminated both the ISPC effect and the list PC effect. In Experiment 2, we used 70 %-valid congruency precues to direct participants to generally expect conflict or congruence on a given trial.

Recent studies suggest that people proactively adjust response parameters in anticipation of a stop signal. In three experiments, we tested the hypothesis that proactive inhibitory control involves adjusting both attentional and response settings, and we explored the relationship with other forms of proactive and anticipatory control. Subjects responded to the color of a stimulus. On some trials, an extra signal occurred. The response to this signal depended on the task context subjects were in: in the `ignore' context, they ignored it; in the `stop' context, they had to withhold their response; and in the `double-response' context, they had to execute a secondary response. An analysis of event-related brain potentials for no signal trials in the stop context revealed that proactive inhibitory control works by biasing the settings of lower-level systems that are involved in stimulus detection, action selection, and action execution. Furthermore, subjects made similar adjustments in the double-response and stop-signal contexts, indicating an overlap between various forms of proactive action control. The results of Experiment 1 also suggest an overlap between proactive inhibitory control and preparatory control in task-switching studies: both require reconfiguration of task-set parameters to bias or alter subordinate processes. We conclude that much of the top-down control in response inhibition tasks takes place before the inhibition signal is presented. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, contact with older adults often fosters multiple stereotypes, which may contribute to ambivalence about aging and poorer health in late life. Online survey data from 457 young adults (M age = 19.4 years; 74% female) were used to explore the relationship between intergenerational contact and ambivalence about self as a future elder. Multiple mediator path analysis was used to test the hypothesis that anxiety, knowledge, and empathy would mediate the impact of intergenerational contact on aging self-ambivalence. Ratings of intergenerational contact predicted ambivalence, but anxiety and empathy mediated the relationship (knowledge did not). Higher ratings of intergenerational contact, lower aging anxiety, and higher empathy predicted lower aging self-ambivalence, which reflected positive expectations for late life in our sample. Intergenerational contact can influence expectations for old age; exchange that fosters empathy and reduces anxiety may encourage individuals to exercise strategies that positively impact health in late life.","2016-05","2018-12-21 17:51:26","2018-12-21 17:51:26","","282-288","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ambivalence; anxiety; attitudes towards aging; empathy; intergenerational contact; knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current investigation tested the hypothesis of dynamic mental number line which was shaped by the relative magnitudes of two operands in simple arithmetic. Horizontal and vertical electrooculograms (HEOG and VEOG) during simple arithmetic were recorded. Results showed that the direction of eye movements was dependent on the relative magnitudes of two operands. Subtraction was associated with larger rightward eye movements than addition (Experiment 1), and smaller-operand-first addition (e.g., 2+9) was associated with larger rightward eye movement than larger-operand-first addition (e.g., 9+2) only when the difference of two operands was large (Experiment 2).

Yet, to date, no research examines whether perspective-taking accuracy can be improved among healthy adult samples. Building off of work suggesting that social working memory (SWM) capacity (i.e., the ability to maintain and manipulate social cognitive information in mind) predicts perspective-taking skills, we developed a novel SWM training intervention to test the hypothesis that SWM training improves perspective-taking accuracy. Participants were randomly assigned to complete 12 days of either SWM training or nonsocial, cognitive working memory (CWM) training (active control condition). Perspective-taking accuracy was assessed pre- and posttraining. SWM training significantly increased perspective-taking accuracy and these improvements significantly surpassed improvements made by participants who underwent CWM training.

Recently, autism and psychotic-affective conditions (mainly schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression) have been posited as psychological `opposites' with regard to social-cognitive phenotypes. Imagination, considered as `forming new ideas, mental images, or concepts', represents a central facet of human social evolution and cognition. Previous studies have documented reduced imagination in autism, and increased imagination in association with psychotic-affective conditions, yet these sets of findings have yet to be considered together, or evaluated in the context of the diametric model. We first review studies of the components, manifestations, and neural correlates of imagination in autism and psychotic affective conditions. Next, we use data on dimensional autism in healthy populations to test the hypotheses that: (1) imagination represents the facet of autism that best accounts for its strongly male-biased sex ratio, and (2) higher genetic risk of schizophrenia is associated with higher imagination, in accordance with the predictions of the diametric model. The first hypothesis was supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis showing that Imagination exhibits the strongest male bias of all Autism Quotient (AQ) subscales, in non-clinical populations. The second hypothesis was supported, for males, by associations between schizophrenia genetic risk scores, derived from a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and the AQ Imagination subscale. Considered together, these findings indicate that imagination, especially social imagination as embodied in the default mode human brain network, mediates risk and diametric dimensional phenotypes of autism and psychotic-affective conditions.

We have previously shown that childhood trauma is associated with increased central corticotrophin-releasing hormone concentration in adults with personality disorder. In the brain, the release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone can be stimulated by noradrenergic neuronal activity, raising the possibility that childhood trauma may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis by altering brain noradrenergic function. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that childhood trauma is associated with blunted growth hormone response to the alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptor agonist clonidine. Methods: All subjects provided written informed consent. Twenty personality disordered and twenty healthy controls (without personality disorder or Axis I psychopathology) underwent challenge with clonidine, while plasma Growth Hormone (GH) concentration was monitored by intravenous catheter. On a different study session, subjects completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and underwent diagnostic interviews. Results: Contrary to our a priori hypothesis, childhood trauma was associated with enhanced GH response to clonidine. This positive relationship was present in the group of 40 subjects and in the subgroup 20 personality disordered subjects, but was not detected in the healthy control subjects when analyzed separately. The presence of personality disorder was unrelated to the magnitude of GH response. Discussion: Childhood trauma is positively correlated with GH response to clonidine challenge in adults with personality disorder. Enhanced rather that blunted GH response differentiates childhood trauma from previously identified negative predictors of GH response, such as anxiety or mood disorder. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although this link has been well established, the mechanisms in this association require further study. High levels of impulsivity and difficulties with emotion regulation are often associated with childhood maltreatment. Negative urgency - an emotion - based facet of impulsivity - is a strong predictor of substance use problems and may be a particularly relevant facet of impulsivity in the link between childhood maltreatment and alcohol and cannabis outcomes. However, few studies have examined the specific mediational pathway from childhood maltreatment to alcohol and cannabis problems through negative urgency. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that the associations between history of childhood maltreatment and current alcohol and cannabis problems would be mediated by negative urgency, but not other facets of impulsivity. Methods: Participants (N = 232), who were in late adolescence (mean age = 19.75), completed self-report measures of different facets of impulsivity, past childhood maltreatment, and current alcohol and cannabis use and problems. Results: In analyses including several facets of impulsivity as simultaneous mediators, negative urgency was the only facet to mediate the associations of childhood maltreatment severity with alcohol and cannabis problems. Conclusions: These findings provide support for negative urgency as a unique mediator of the associations between childhood maltreatment and both alcohol and cannabis problems, suggesting that future work on mechanisms in these associations should focus on mood-based impulsivity.

We measured fasting glucose, lipid profile parameters, homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 in 135 patients with FES and 146 healthy controls (HCs). Polymorphisms in the following genes were determined: MTHFR (C677T and A1298C), MTHFD1 (G1958A), MTRR (A66G) and BHMT (G742A). Serum levels of folate and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) were significantly lower in patients with FES compared to HCs. In turn, serum levels of homocysteine and triglycerides were significantly higher in patients with FES than in HCs. Prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia, low folate and HDL levels together with dyslipidemia was significantly higher in patients with FES compared to HCs. Higher homocysteine levels, lower vitamin B12 levels and the presence of metabolic syndrome were associated with higher severity of negative symptoms. None of studied polymorphisms was associated with schizophrenia risk. Several associations between studied polymorphisms and cardio-metabolic parameters were found. None of them remained significant after Bonferroni correction.

Using a source monitoring paradigm, previous studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia made more errors in source monitoring, suggesting that a weakened sense of individuality may be associated with psychotic symptoms. However, no studies have verified a relationship between sense of individuality and dissociation, and it is unclear whether an altered sense of individuality is a shared sociocognitive deficit underlying both dissociation and psychosis. Method : Data from 80 acute psychiatric patients with unspecified mental disorders were analyzed to test the hypothesis that an altered sense of individuality underlies dissociation and psychosis. Behavioral tasks, including tests of intelligence and source monitoring, as well as interview schedules and self-report measures of dissociative and psychotic symptoms, general psychopathology, and trauma history, were administered. Results : Significant correlations of medium effect sizes indicated an association between errors attributing the source of self-generated items and positive psychotic symptoms and the absorption and amnesia measures of dissociation. The associations with dissociative measures remained significant after the effects of intelligence, general psychopathology, and trauma history were excluded. Moreover, the relationships between source misattribution and dissociative measures remained marginally significant and significant after controlling for positive and negative psychotic symptoms, respectively. Limitations : Self-reported measures were collected from a small sample, and most of the participants were receiving medications when tested, which may have influenced their cognitive performance. Conclusions : A tendency to misidentify the source of self-generated items characterized both dissociation and psychosis. An altered sense of individuality embedded in self-referential representations appears to be a common sociocognitive deficit of dissociation and psychosis.","2016-04-21","2018-12-21 17:51:31","2018-12-21 17:51:31","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","dissociation; generation effect; psychosis; self; source monitoring; trauma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed four indirect measures sensitive to changes specifically occurring in supragranular cortical layers, and applied these to test the hypothesis that supragranular layers are disproportionately affected in schizophrenia. Our findings from the four different measures converge to indicate a predominance of supragranular thinning in schizophrenia, independent of medication and illness duration.

The present research tested the hypotheses that (a) simply having a symbol leads collections of individuals to seem more like real, unified groups, (b) this increased psychological realness leads groups to seem more threatening and effective to others, and (c) group members therefore strategically emphasize symbols when they want their group to appear unified and intimidating. In Studies 1a-1c, participants perceived various task groups as more entitative when they happened to have a symbol. In Study 2, symbols not only helped groups make up for lacking a physical characteristic associated with entitativity (physical similarity), but also led groups to seem more threatening. Study 3 examined the processes underlying this effect and found that group symbols increase entitativity by increasing perceived cohesiveness. Study 4 extended our results to show that symbols not only shape the impressions people form of novel groups, but also change people's existing impressions of more familiar and real-world social groups, making them seem more entitative and competent but also less warm. Finally, Studies 5a and 5b further expand our understanding of the psychological function of symbols by showing that group members strategically display symbols when they are motivated to convey an impression of their group as unified and threatening (vs. inclusive and cooperative). We discuss implications for understanding how group members navigate their social identities.","2016-04","2018-12-21 17:51:34","2018-12-21 17:51:34","","528-550","","4","110","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cohesiveness; entitativity; group perception; identity symbols","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that the PCSK6 VNTR polymorphism rs1053972 influences the expression of handedness and aspects of dimensional schizotypy and autism. For a sample of 709 healthy individuals, rs1053972 genotype was significantly associated with categorical measures of handedness, and with dimensional handedness in subsets of the population with high schizotypy and magical ideation or a lack of strong right-handedness. Both findings showed evidence of stronger or exclusive effects among females, compared to males. Genotypes of PCSK6 also showed significant sex limited associations with magical ideation, a component of positive schizotypal cognition measured using the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, and total autism score, measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient.

The sample comprised 144 entrepreneurs, mostly male (65.3%) and mostly ages 35 to 45 years (40.3%), who filled an online questionnaire measuring the variables of sharing of understanding, motivation, communication encoding competencies, source credibility, knowledge transfer, and organizational change. Data were collected between 2011 and 2012 and measured the relationship between clients and consultants working in a Portuguese small- and medium-sized enterprise-oriented action learning program. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling was conducted to identify the antecedents of sharing of understanding, motivational, and communicational variables, which were positively correlated with the knowledge transfer between consultants and clients. This transfer was also positively correlated with organizational change.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study using healthcare administrative databases in Ontario, Canada included 1,749 lithium users, 1,787 valproic acid users, and 285,154 other antidepressant users >= 66 years old having used the drug continuously in monotherapy for at least 1 year. Outcome measures were start of (1) a dopaminergic medication (levodopa or a dopamine agonist), (2) any antiparkinson drug (levodopa, dopamine agonists, anticholinergic medication, amantadine, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors), (3) any antiparkinson drug or a diagnostic code for PD, and (4) any antiparkinson drug in the absence of a diagnostic code for PD. Results: For patients with no previous antipsychotic use, lithium monotherapy was associated with an increased incidence of dopaminergic drug use (adjusted HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.06-3.30) and an increased incidence of antiparkinson drug use or a PD diagnosis (adjusted HR: 1. 68; 95% CI: 1.13-2.48) compared with antidepressant monotherapy.

Accordingly, it uses “reward exposure” (engagement in meaningful, rewarding activities) as its principal intervention. This study tests the hypothesis that change in behavioral activation, an index of positive valence systems function, during successive treatment periods with Engage and during follow-up predicts depression at the end of each period. Methods: Forty-eight nondemented, older adults with unipolar major depression were treated openly with 9 weekly sessions of Engage and assessed 36 weeks after entry. Depression severity was assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and behavioral activation with the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 9 weeks (end of treatment), and 36 weeks. Results: A mixed-effects model examined whether change in BADS in successive periods occurring during Engage treatment and during follow-up predicts depression at the end of each period. Both BADS change (F-1,F-52 = 18.63, p < 0.0001) and time (F-2,F-52 = 7.68, p = 0.0012) predicted HAM-D scores at the end of each observation period. Every point of increase in BADS change reduced the HAM-D by 0.105 points. HAM-D at each point did not predict subsequent change in BADS (F1,52 = 2.17, p = 0.146).

The experiments tested the hypothesis that these children link elements of writing not to the phonological forms of spoken words but to physical characteristics of the words' referents. In Experiment 1, prephonological spellers (n = 36, mean age 4 years, 3 months) used more elements on average to write plural nouns such as cows than singular nouns such as cow. Prephonological spellers in Experiment 2 (n =42, mean age 4 years, 4 months) did not use more elements to write longer verbs such as buying than shorter ones such as buy. Thus, the results of Experiment 1 suggest that prephonological spellers are sensitive to the quantity of the referent rather than the number of phonemes, syllables, or morphemes in the word. That is, prephonological spellers have some tendency to treat writing as iconic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding the potential associations and characteristics of individuals who steal may help educational institutions, health services and young people themselves resolve difficulties before the behaviour impacts on their academic performance and health. AimsWe aim to test the hypothesis that desires to steal among students would be associated with worse academic achievements and higher rates of mood and impulse control disorders. MethodsOne thousand eight hundred and five students completed the College Student Computer User Survey online and were included in this analysis at a large Midwestern United States University. Responders were grouped according to self-reported stealing urges and behaviours and were compared on measures of psychosocial function, mental health disorders and impulsivity. ResultsUrges to steal were associated with worse depressive symptoms, higher levels of perceived stress and a number of psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder and multiple disorders of impulse control (kleptomania, compulsive sexual behaviour, skin picking, trichotillomania and compulsive buying). Conclusions and implications for practice and/or future research These following data indicate that stealing for many college students may be considered within a spectrum of impulsive behaviours. Illegal behaviours among students point to mental health difficulties among them. Our findings may provide clinicians, researchers and health professionals with a clearer picture of a range of impulsive behaviours among college students and promote treatment for this group. Our findings could also inform preventative approaches to impulsive problems in young adults.

In England and Wales, successive governments and independent reports have argued that the equivalent of community care in prisons is acceptable but that some mental health assessment units (MHAUs), staffed by professional clinicians, should remain. These have not been researched. AimsThis paper aimed to explore patterns of use of a MHAU in a women's prison in England and to test the hypothesis that it was being used only, as intended - to hold women pending transfer to a health service hospital or in a bona fide crisis. MethodsAnonymised data on all women transferred to one MHAU between 1 January 2008 and 31 August 2010 were obtained from the prison files and subjected to descriptive analysis. ResultsLess than a third of these women were transferred to an outside hospital; this group stayed longest in the unit. An overlapping group of 52% of the women was under a special assessment, care in custody and teamwork protocol because of suicide or serious self-harm risk. Thus, 188 (68%) admissions fulfilled national protocol criteria for MHAU admissions. Two in five women admitted were released or returned to ordinary prison locations. Nevertheless, over 80% of the women were known to external mental health services, and 64 (30%) were so unwell on arrival in prison that they were transferred directly to the MHAU. Over a third of admissions were of women admitted more than once during the 32 months of study, and this was significantly more likely after release from prison directly to the community. Conclusions Our hypothesis was not sustained, and it seems unlikely that this prison MHAU is unique in being used outside its strict remit. A shift from studying the epidemiology of mental disorder in prisons to the epidemiology of mental health needs could benefit this vulnerable group and the wider community alike.

We tested the hypotheses that childhood SES is related to C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, factor VIIc, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in midlife women and that the associations are mediated by adult SES and/or adult body mass index (BMI). Methods: Using data from the prospective Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, we classified 1067 black and whitewomen into 3multidimensional childhood SES groups based on latent class analysis. Biological measures were assessed across 7 years along with covariates and mediators and analyzed by mixed regression models, followed by tests for mediation. Results: Compared with women raised in high SES families, those from the lowest SES families had higher levels of CRP (b [standard error] = 0.37 [0.11]), PAI-1 (b = 0.23 [0.07]) factor VIIc (b = 0.05 [0.02]), and fibrinogen (b = 11.06 [4.89]), after adjustment for ethnicity, site, age, ratings of health between ages 11 and 18 years, visit, smoking status, menopausal status, stroke or heart attack, medications, and hormone use. Introduction of adult SES and BMI into the models reduced the childhood SES associations to nonsignificance for all four measures. Indirect mediation was apparent for adult education and BMI for CRP, and BMI for PAI-1. Conclusions: Women raised in lower SES families had elevated markers of inflammation and hemostasis, in part, due to elevated BMI and education in adulthood.","2016-04","2018-12-21 17:51:41","2018-12-21 17:51:41","","311-318","","3","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","childhood; hemostasis; inflammation; race; Socioeconomic status; women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we test the hypothesis that individuals with ASC will show enhanced orientation discrimination compared with neurotypical observers. This prediction is based both on anecdotal report of superior discriminatory skills in ASC and also on evidence in the auditory domain that some individuals with ASC have superior pitch discrimination. In order to establish whether atypical perception might be mediated by an imbalance in the ratio of neural excitation and inhibition (E: I ratio), we also measured peak gamma frequency, which provides an indication of neural inhibition levels. Using a rigorous thresholding method, we found that orientation discrimination thresholds for obliquely oriented stimuli were significantly lower in participants with ASC. Using EEG to measure the visually induced gamma band response, we also found that peak gamma frequency was higher in participants with ASC, relative to a well-matched control group. These novel results suggest that neural inhibition may be increased in the occipital cortex of individuals with ASC. Implications for existing theories of an imbalance in the E: I ratio of ASC are discussed.","2016-04","2018-12-21 17:51:42","2018-12-21 17:51:42","","412-422","","3","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","autism; electroencephalography; gamma activity; neural inhibition; perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A randomized clinical trial","SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH","","0920-9964","10.1016/j.schres.2016.02.011","","Background: Schizophrenia is a disabling complex mental disorder and despite all available treatment, many patients unfortunately remain partial-or non-responders. A large body of research has shown that oxytocin is an important prosocial peptide and there is initial evidence that the central oxytocin system is altered in several mental disorders. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of oxytocin, as augmentation therapy, in a sample of patients with schizophrenia. Methods: We conducted an 8-month randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with a crossover design. We wanted to test the hypothesis that intranasal oxytocin could reduce symptoms in 32 patients with schizophrenia aged 18-45 with short-medium illness duration (<11 years). Patients were randomly assigned to either 40 International Units oxytocin once daily or a vehicle placebo group, in addition to their pre-study antipsychotic medication regimen. We subsequently conducted a multi-dimensional assessment including psychopathological, psychosocial and neuropsychological aspects. Results: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores showed no significant differences in treatment effects between the experimental group and controls. Furthermore, no treatment effects were shown in any of the rating scales used in this study. However, a statistically significant period effect was shown in most outcome measurements. Conclusions: In our trial, oxytocin did not add any significant beneficial effects to anti-psychotic treatment in terms of clinical symptoms or psychosocial functioning. Further research should focus on different ways to administer oxytocin, or investigate predictors (such as past traumas, or biomarkers), which could identify subgroups of patients with different treatment responses to oxytocin.

In addition, we looked at individual differences in terms of people's sensitivity to affective information and how efficiently they regulate it, that is, trait emotional intelligence. We demonstrated that people who are more sensitive to affective information have larger pupil dilation when looking at the past performance of a stock fund. In addition, we also found that participants' larger pupil dilation had an impact on their investment decisions (whether people were more likely to sell their shares, hold on to the investment, or buy more shares). A larger pupil dilation led people to be more consistent and willing to invest more money on a fund regardless from its past performance (positive or negative). We also tested the hypothesis that individuals with a larger pupil dilation should be more influenced by a fund's past performance (e.g., selling their shares more often when the past performance of the fund was negative and buying additional shares more often when the past performance was positive). However, results did not support this explanation. Finally, our data revealed that the effect of individual differences in trait emotional intelligence on investment decisions was significantly mediated by pupil dilation. In the discussion, we explored the relationship between our results and previous evidence on the role of pupil dilation in processing information under uncertainty and the role of affect in decision making.

In a previous investigation of a large population cohort, impaired emotional/social cognitive' processing, assessed by questionnaire, was observed to mediate the link between COMT Val158Met and aggression in individuals with ADHD. We set out to replicate and extend this finding in a clinical sample, using task-based and physiological assessments of emotional and cognitive processing. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that directly assessed emotional processing mediates the link between COMT Val158Met and aggression in young people with ADHD. MethodsMales aged 10-17years with ADHD were recruited from UK community clinics (n=194). Research diagnostic interviews (parent and child) were used to assess psychopathology and generate DSM-IV Conduct Disorder symptom scores. Participants completed tasks assessing executive function (response inhibition and set shifting), empathy for fear, sadness and happiness, and fear conditioning [measured using skin conductance responses (SCR) to aversive stimuli]. ResultsCOMT Val allele carriers showed poorer response inhibition (F=5.27, p=.02) and set shifting abilities (F=6.45, p=.01), reduced fear empathy (F=4.33, p=.04) and reduced autonomic responsiveness (lower SCRs) to the conditioned aversive stimulus (F=11.74, p=.001). COMT Val158Met did not predict impairments in recognising others' emotions or affective empathy for happiness or sadness. Mediation analysis revealed that impaired fear-related mechanisms indirectly mediated the link between COMT Val158Met and aggression. ConclusionOur findings suggest fear mechanisms as possible targets for psychological interventions to disrupt links between genetic risk and aggressive outcomes in ADHD. Our findings also reveal the potential of hypothesis-driven approaches for identifying neuropsychological mechanisms that mediate genetic risk effects on behaviour and psychopathology.","2016-04","2018-12-21 17:51:45","2018-12-21 17:51:45","","472-480","","4","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ADHD; aggression; child; COMT; conduct disorder; genetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have tested this theory using between-person and between-group comparisons, with conflicting results. In contrast, prior research has not examined the effects of within-person fluctuations in HAP on CP. MethodThis study tested the hypothesis that within-person variation in HAP would positively predict subsequent within-person variation in CP, in two population samples of youth (N=620) who participated in identical methods of assessment over the course of 30months. Three-level, hierarchical models were used to test for within-person, longitudinal associations between HAP and CP, as well as moderating effects of between-person and between-family demographics.

Adaptations of CT focusing heavily on patients' core beliefs have yielded promising findings in the treatment of PD. However, there have been no investigations that have specifically tested whether increased focus on maladaptive beliefs contributes to CT's efficacy for these patients. Method: CT technique use from an early CT session was assessed for 59 patients (33 without PD, 26 with PD-predominantly Cluster C) who participated in a randomized controlled trial for moderate to severe MDD. Scores were calculated for directive CT techniques (CT-Concrete) and a set of belief-focused items (CT-Belief) as rated by the Collaborative Study Process Rating Scale. Robust regressions were conducted to estimate relations between scores on each of these measures and change in depressive and PD symptoms. A PD status by CT-Belief use interaction tested the hypothesis that therapist use of CT-Belief techniques would exhibit a stronger association with symptom change in the PD group relative to the non-PD group. Results: As hypothesized, a significant interaction between PD status and use of CT-Belief techniques emerged in the prediction of depressive and PD symptom change. Among PD patients, higher early CT-Belief interventions were found to predict significantly greater improvement. CT-Belief use did not predict greater symptom change among those without PD. Conclusions: Early focus on CT-Belief interventions may facilitate changes in depression and PD symptoms for patients with MDD-PD comorbidity.","2016-04","2018-12-21 17:51:46","2018-12-21 17:51:46","","353-364","","4","84","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adherence; cognitive therapy; depression; personality disorders; psychotherapy process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that our ability to experience and label our own emotions in a differentiated and specific manner is related to the ability to accurately perceive the level of emotions in others. In an experience sampling study among romantic couples, we tested the hypothesis that individuals with higher levels of emotion differentiation are characterized by higher levels of empathic accuracy (i.e., judge others' emotions more accurately). In line with expectations, results showed that individuals who differentiate highly between their negative emotions are more able to accurately infer how pleasant their partners are feeling across daily life. This finding establishes a link between perceptions of our own and others' emotions and provides evidence that the skills we use to understand our own emotions are also relevant for understanding how others feel.","2016-04","2018-12-21 17:51:47","2018-12-21 17:51:47","","240-247","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","emotion; emotion differentiation; emotion knowledge; emotional granularity; empathic accuracy; mind reading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, the study aims to determine whether emotion regulation and behaviour problems mediate the relationship between parental rejection and academic sucess. A sample of children (N = 189) was recruited from 3 francophone elementary schools in the greater Montreal area. Children completed questionnaires measuring perceived maternal rejection, emotion regulation and prosocial and antisocial behaviours. Academic success was measured by combining children's final grades in mathematics and French. In order to test the hypothesis of a mediator model, the indirect effect of maternal rejection on academic success through emotional regulation and behaviours was estimated using the “PROCESS” statistical tool (Hayes, 2013). Results indicate that emotion regulation acts as a mediator of the relationship between maternal rejection and academic success. However, prosocial and antisocial behaviours were not identified as mediators of this relationship. These results suggest that emotion regulation contributes to explain the process by which children that feel more rejected by their mother are less successful in school. Thus, improving emotion regulation in children who feel rejected may reduce their academic vulnerability.","2016-04","2018-12-21 17:51:48","2018-12-21 17:51:48","","132-141","","2","48","","","","","","","","","","French","","","","","","","","","","","academic success; emotional regulation; parental rejection; psychological abuse; social behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: Drawing from self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000), the current study tested the hypothesis that alcohol-related and academic motives would be associated with one another along internal vs. external focused dimensions. We also examined the relative influence of these motives on alcohol consumption. Methods: College students (N = 226) completed self-report measures assessing drinking motives, abstinence motives, academic motives, and alcohol-related outcomes. Results: Findings suggest that drinking motives are related to abstinence motives but not academic motives. Both forms of alcohol-related motives were related to alcohol use and consequences; no associations between academic motives and alcohol variables were observed. Conclusions/importance: The lack of associations among academic motives, alcohol-related motives, and alcohol variables departs from previous findings suggesting that academic motives impact alcohol use. The current findings indicate a greater understanding of the interplay of motivational sets related to salient issues for youth, such as academics, is needed in order to expand intervention models for alcohol use in such populations.

The neural underpinnings of anxiety in individuals with WS are currently unknown. Aberrations in the anatomical and microstructural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus (UF) have been recently implicated in social and generalized anxiety disorders. Based on these findings, we tested the hypothesis that the reported anxieties in individuals with WS share similar neuropathological correlates. Toward this end, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods were employed to examine the microstructural integrity (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, longitudinal diffusivity) of the UF in 18 WS and 15 typically developing adults (TD). Anxiety and sociability questionnaires were administered to determine associations with DTI indices of UF across groups. Results revealed comparable white matter integrity of the UF across groups, yet elevated subjective experience of anxiety in those with WS. Additionally, sociability and UF microstructural properties were dissociated across both groups. Whereas no relationships were found between DTI indices and anxiety in TD participants, strong negative associations were observed between these constructs in individuals with WS. Findings indicated that increased anxiety manifested by individuals with WS was associated with DTI measures of the UF and may signal structural or possibly physiological aberration involving this tract within the prefrontal-temporal network.","2016-03-03","2018-12-21 17:51:51","2018-12-21 17:51:51","","187-192","","2","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anxiety; DTI; Sociability; Uncinate fasciculus; Williams syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to test the hypothesis that latent T. gondii infection, as manifest by circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to T. gondii, is associated with both categorical and dimensional measures of aggression. Method: IgG antibodies to T. gondii were collected between 1991 and 2008 from 358 adult subjects with DSM-5 intermittent explosive disorder (IED), non-IED psychiatric disorders (psychiatric controls), or no evidence of any psychiatric diagnosis (healthy controls). Assessments of aggression, anger, and impulsivity, as well as state/trait anger, depression, and anxiety were completed. T. gondii seropositive status (IgG > 12 IU) was the primary outcome measure for this study. Results: T. gondii seropositive status (IgG > 12 IU) was associated with higher aggression (P = .022) and impulsivity (P = .05) scores. When both aggression and impulsivity scores were controlled for, however, only aggression scores were higher in seropositive subjects (P = .011). In addition, T. gondii seropositive status and marginal mean +/- SE aggression scores increased from healthy controls (9.1% and -0.66 +/- 0.05) to psychiatric controls (16.7% and -0.27 +/- 0.05) to subjects with IED (21.8% and 1.15 +/- 0.06; P = .05). These findings were not accounted for by the presence of other syndromal/personality disorders or by states or traits related to depressed or anxious moods. Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous studies suggesting a relationship between T. gondii and self-directed aggression (ie, suicidal behavior) and further add to the biological complexity of impulsive aggression both from a categorical and a dimensional perspective.

In rodents, opioid intake has been associated with abnormal acquisition and extinction of avoidance behavior. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these findings would generalize to human opioid-dependent subjects. Method: Adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for heroin dependence and treated with opioid medication (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 26) were recruited between March 2013 and October 2013 and given a computer-based task to assess avoidance behavior. For this task, subjects controlled a spaceship and could either gain points by shooting an enemy spaceship or hide in safe areas to avoid on-screen aversive events. Hiding duration during different periods of the task was used to measure avoidance behavior. Results: While groups did not differ on escape responding (hiding) during the aversive event, heroin-dependent men (but not women) made more avoidance responses during a warning signal that predicted the aversive event (analysis of variance, sex x group interaction, P = .007). Heroindependent men were also slower to extinguish the avoidance response when the aversive event no longer followed the warning signal (P = .011). This behavioral pattern resulted in reduced opportunity to obtain reward without reducing risk of punishment. Results suggest that, in male patients, differences in avoidance behavior cannot be easily explained by impaired task performance or by exaggerated motor activity. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for abnormal acquisition and extinction of avoidance behavior in opioid-dependent patients. Interestingly, data suggest that abnormal avoidance is demonstrated only by male patients. Findings shed light on cognitive and behavioral manifestations of opioid addiction and may facilitate development of therapeutic approaches to help affected individuals.

We developed a model of chronic psychosocial stress (CPS) in which subordinate mice are vulnerable to obesity and the metabolic-like syndrome while dominant mice exhibit a healthy metabolic phenotype. Here we tested the hypothesis that the metabolic difference between subordinate and dominant mice is associated with changes in functional pathways relevant for insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid homeostasis. Male mice were exposed to CPS for four weeks and fed either a standard diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). We first measured, by real-time PCR candidate genes, in the liver, skeletal muscle, and the perigonadal white adipose tissue (pWAT). Subsequently, we used a probabilistic analysis approach to analyze different ways in which signals can be transmitted across the pathways in each tissue. Results showed that subordinate mice displayed a drastic downregulation of the insulin pathway in liver and muscle, indicative of insulin resistance, already on standard diet. Conversely, pWAT showed molecular changes suggestive of facilitated fat deposition in an otherwise insulin-sensitive tissue. The molecular changes in subordinate mice fed a standard diet were greater compared to HFD-fed controls. Finally, dominant mice maintained a substantially normal metabolic and molecular phenotype even when fed a HFD. Overall, our data demonstrate that subordination stress is a potent stimulus for the downregulation of the insulin signaling pathway in liver and muscle and a major risk factor for the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.","2016-03","2018-12-21 17:51:54","2018-12-21 17:51:54","","214-224","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adipose tissue; insulin; IRS1; IRS2; metabolic syndrome; obesity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we utilized the monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor JZL184 to selectively augment brain 2-AG levels combined with an auditory cue fear-conditioning paradigm to test the hypothesis that 2-AG-mediated eCB signaling modulates short-term fear extinction learning in mice. We show that systemic JZL184 impairs short-term extinction learning in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner without affecting non-specific freezing behavior or the acquisition of conditioned fear. This effect was also observed in over-conditioned mice environmentally manipulated to re-acquire fear extinction. Cumulatively, the effects of JZL184 appear to be partly due to augmentation of 2-AG signaling in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), as direct microinfusion of JZL184 into the BLA produced similar results. Moreover, we elucidate a short similar to 3-day temporal window during which 2-AG augmentation impairs extinction behavior, suggesting a preferential role for 2-AG-mediated eCB signaling in the modulation of short-term behavioral sequelae to acute traumatic stress exposure.","2016-03-01","2018-12-21 17:51:55","2018-12-21 17:51:55","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, less is known about the effects of being empathic for parents. The current study tested the hypothesis that, although parental empathy may be beneficial to children both psychologically and physiologically, it may take a physiological toll on parents. Method: The current study examined psychological and physiological correlates of parental empathy in 247 parent-adolescent dyads. During a baseline laboratory visit, parents and adolescents provide blood samples from which markers of systemic inflammation, including interleukin 1-ra, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein, were assayed. Parents completed self-report questionnaires of empathy, well-being, and self-esteem, and also reported on their child's emotion regulation. Following the laboratory visit, adolescents completed 2 weeks of daily diary reporting on their emotion regulation abilities. Results: In adolescents, parental empathy was significantly associated with both better emotion regulation and with less systemic inflammation. For parents, being empathic was associated with greater self-esteem and purpose in life, but also with higher systemic inflammation. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the importance of simultaneously considering both psychological and physical health-related effects of psychosocial traits and suggests that empathy may have diverging effects across providers and recipients of empathy.","2016-03","2018-12-21 17:51:56","2018-12-21 17:51:56","","211-218","","3","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescent development; emotional control; inflammation; interpersonal relationships; relationship quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In clinical staging models, cognitive impairment is one of the hallmarks to define the clinical stage and it plays an important role in identifying the risk factors for progression to later stages of the illness. It is important to examine neurocognitive performance over longer periods to test the hypothesis of neuroprogression of bipolar disorder. MethodsA comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was applied at baseline and five years later to 56 euthymic older outpatients with bipolar disorder (mean age = 68.35 years, range: 60-90 years) and to a demographically matched sample of 44 healthy subjects. A group-by-time repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was performed to measure changes over time for the two groups. The impact of baseline illness characteristics on the intra-individual change in neurocognitive performance within the bipolar disorder group was studied by using logistic regression analysis. ResultsAt baseline and at follow-up, patients with bipolar disorder performed worse on all neurocognitive measures compared to the matched healthy subjects. However, there was no significant group-by-time interaction between the patients with bipolar disorder and the comparison group. ConclusionsAlthough older patients with bipolar disorder had worse cognitive function than healthy subjects, they did not have greater cognitive decline over a five-year period. The change in acquired cognitive impairment of patients with bipolar disorder might parallel the cognitive development as seen in normal aging.","2016-03","2018-12-21 17:51:56","2018-12-21 17:51:56","","148-154","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; cognition; old age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The association between substance abuse and parenting may result, in part, from parents' emotional disengagement from the parent-child relationship, which makes perceiving and responding to children's cues more challenging. In this study, we examined whether substance-abusing mothers' levels of disengagement from their relationship with their children (ages 2-44 months), operationalized in two different ways using parenting narratives (representational and linguistic disengagement), prospectively predicted children's engagement and disengagement cues during a structured mother-child interaction. Within a sample of 29 mothers, we tested the hypotheses that greater maternal disengagement at Time 1 would predict a decrease in children's engagement and an increase in children's disengagement at Time 2. Results indicated that representational disengagement predicted a decrease in children's engagement cues whereas linguistic disengagement predicted an increase in children's disengagement cues. Results provide partial support for a reciprocal, iterative process in which mothers and children mutually adjust their emotional and behavioral disengagement with one another.","2016-04","2018-12-21 17:51:57","2018-12-21 17:51:57","","140-150","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","behavioral cues; disengagement; mother-child interaction; sensitivity; substance abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After each sentence, participants saw a cue indicating forget or remember (Experiment 1, n = 89) or important or not important (Experiment 2, n = 123) or control cue (Experiment 3, n = 198). Findings revealed that, among participants who remembered the transgression, being told to intentionally forget the transgression led to increased forgiveness (Experiments 1 & 3). However, being told that the transgression was not important had no effect on forgiveness (Experiment 2). Overall, results are consistent with the hypothesis that an active process of intentional forgetting (as opposed to a passive process of disregarding unimportant information) can promote forgiveness. The interpersonal and clinical applications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hypotheses were partly confirmed. In Study 1, N=126 overweight women (age: 19-77years) intended to lose weight by means of a low-calorie diet. In Study 2, N=322 adults (age: 18-82years) reported on their action orientation to replicate the association of age and action orientation found in Study 1. Study 2 corroborated only the expected positive association of age and decision-related action orientation. In Study 1, decision-related action orientation predicted higher affective well-being during the diet as well as less self-reported deviations from the diet; failure-related action orientation predicted lower levels of rumination in response to dieting failures. Action orientation partially mediated the negative effects of age on deviations and rumination (see Hennecke & Freund, ). Weight loss was not predicted by action orientation.

This effect occurs because busy people tend to perceive that they are using their time effectively, which mitigates the sense of failure people have when they miss a task deadline. Studies 1 and 2 show that when people are busy, they are more motivated to complete a task after missing a deadline than those who are not busy, and that the perception that one is using time effectively mediates this effect. Studies 3 and 4 show that this process makes busy people more likely to complete real tasks than people who are not busy. Study 5 uses data from over half a million tasks submitted by thousands of users of a task management software application to show that busy people take less time to complete a task after they miss a deadline for completing it.

This relationship was not observed among people who grew up in low-SES environments.

Consequently, the purpose of this investigation was to demonstrate, in an accessible manner, the nature of the proportionality constraint. Secondly, it was hypothesized that the degree to which the proportionality constraint is violated will correlate perfectly with the degree to which the bifactor model fits better than the higher-order model. Finally, it was hypothesized that the bifactor model will not necessarily be favoured based on fit-indices which incorporate a penalty for model complexity (TLI, AIC, BIC). To test the hypothesis, a series of 12 correlation matrices were simulated such that the proportionality constraint violation increased progressively. The magnitude of the violation was observed to correlate essentially perfectly with the degree of model fit difference between the higher-order and the bifactor model. At moderate to high levels of proportionality constraint violation, the TLI favoured the bifactor model. Importantly, however, at low levels of proportionality constraint violation, the TLI favoured the higher-order consistently across all three sample sizes. The results associated with the chi-square difference test, AIC, and BIC were much more greatly affected by sample size. The results are interpreted to suggest that the proportionality constraint needs to be taken into consideration when comparing the higher-order model and the bifactor model. Additionally, fit indices which incorporate a penalty for model complexity do not necessarily favour the bifactor model. Consequently, researchers are encouraged to consider the bifactor model in appropriate research scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis of reduced functional network segregation in autistic patients compared with controls. Methods Functional MRI data from children acquired under a resting-state protocol (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange [ABIDE]) were submitted to both fuzzy spectral clustering (FSC) with entropy analysis and graph modularity analysis. Results We included data from 814 children in our analysis. We identified 5 regions of interest comprising the motor, temporal and occipito-temporal cortices with increased entropy (p < 0.05) in the clustering structure (i.e., more segregation in the controls). Moreover, we noticed a statistically reduced modularity (p < 0.001) in the autistic patients compared with the controls. Significantly reduced eigenvector centrality values (p < 0.05) in the patients were observed in the same regions that were identified in the FSC analysis. Limitations There is considerable heterogeneity in the fMRI acquisition protocols among the sites that contributed to the ABIDE data set (e.g., scanner type, pulse sequence, duration of scan and resting-state protocol). Moreover, the sites differed in many variables related to sample characterization (e.g., age, IQ and ASD diagnostic criteria). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional differences in functional network organization would be found in a more homogeneous data sample of individuals with ASD. Conclusion Our results suggest that the organization of the whole-brain functional network in patients with ASD is different from that observed in controls, which implies a reduced modularity of the brain functional networks involved in sensorimotor, social, affective and cognitive processing.","2016-03","2018-12-21 17:52:03","2018-12-21 17:52:03","","124-132","","2","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to develop walking-specific motivation measures drawn from self-determination theory (SDT), assess the psychometric properties of the measures, incorporating Baysesian structural equation modelling (BSEM), and examine how these variables relate to walking behaviour. Method: Participants (n = 298; mean age = 41.69; S.D. = 11.06; male = 57) completed the Behavioural Regulations in Walking Questionnaire (BRWQ), Psychological Needs Satisfaction for Walking Scale (PNSWS) and the IPAQ-long form, from which measures of workplace, transport and leisure walking were extracted. BSEM was used to test the hypothesized factor structures of the BRWQ and PNSWS. Internal reliabilities were assessed using the composite reliability coefficient. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed by examining the relationships between the variables in relation to established theory. Results: BSEM showed excellent fit for the BRWQ and PNSWS measurement models. The scales demonstrated good internal consistency. The associations within and between the BRWQ and PNSWS subscales were generally as expected. The relationship between the BRWQ subscales and walking for transport and leisure were also generally as expected, but there were no significant relationships for walking at work. Two PNSWS subscales were significantly related to walking for leisure, but no significant relationships were evident for walking for transport and at work. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence for the acceptable psychometric properties of instruments to measure SDT constructs in walking, and the findings highlight the advantages of BSEM. The findings also suggest that the motivational processes underpinning walking may vary by type of walking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper features two studies in which participants have been asked to ignore sequences of sound while focusing attention on a silent movie. The sequences consisted of blocks, each with a high-probability repetition interrupted by rare acoustic deviations (i.e., a sound of different pitch or duration). The probabilities of the two different sounds alternated across the concatenated blocks within the sequence (i.e., short-to-long and long-to-short). The sound probabilities are rapidly and automatically learned for each block and a perceptual inference is formed predicting the most likely characteristics of the upcoming sound. Deviations elicit a prediction error signal known as mismatch negativity (MMN). Computational models of MMN generally assume that its elicitation is governed by transition statistics that define what sound attributes are most likely to follow the current sound. MMN amplitude reflects prediction confidence, which is derived from the stability of the current transition statistics. However, our prior research showed that MMN amplitude is modulated by a strong first-impression bias that outweighs transition statistics. Here we test the hypothesis that this bias can be attributed to assumptions about predictable vs. unpredictable nature of each tone within the first encountered context, which is weighted by the stability of that context. The results of Study 1 show that this bias is initially prevented if there is no 1:1 mapping between sound attributes and probability, but it returns once the auditory system determines which properties provide the highest predictive value. The results of Study 2 show that confidence in the first-impression bias drops if assumptions about the temporal stability of the transition-statistics are violated. Both studies provide compelling evidence that the auditory system extrapolates patterns on multiple timescales to adjust its response to prediction-errors, while profoundly distorting the effects of transition-statistics by the assumptions formed on the basis of first-impressions.

Although empirical evidence indicates that self-esteem serves as a buffer against mortality threats, the precise neural mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that self-esteem modulates neural responses to death-related stimuli, especially functional connectivity within the limbic-frontal circuitry, thereby affecting subsequent defensive reactions. As predicted, individuals with high self-esteem subjected to a mortality threat exhibited increased amygdala-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) connectivity during the processing of death-related stimuli compared with individuals who have low self-esteem. Further analysis revealed that stronger functional connectivity between the amygdala and the VLPFC predicted a subsequent decline in responding defensively to those who threaten one's beliefs. These results suggest that the amygdala-VLPFC interaction, which is modulated by self-esteem, can reduce the defensiveness caused by death-related stimuli, thereby providing a neural explanation for why individuals with high self-esteem exhibit less defensive reactions to mortality threats.","2016-03","2018-12-21 17:52:05","2018-12-21 17:52:05","","273-283","","3","145","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","amygdala; death; functional connectivity; self-esteem; VLPFC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was also tested whether responders and remitters have different pharmacokinetics, blood and brain lithium levels (ratio) compared with those presenting suboptimal antidepressant improvement. MethodTwenty-three patients with bipolar disorder (I and II) during depressive episodes were included and followed up for 6 weeks at the University of Sao Paulo using flexible dose of lithium (450-900 mg/day). Sixteen patients were drug-naive. At endpoint, patients underwent a Li-7-MRS scan and brain lithium concentrations were calculated. ResultsA significant association between central and peripheral lithium levels was found only in remitters (r = 0.7, P = 0.004) but not in non-remitters (r = -0.12, P = 0.76). Also, brain lithium (but not plasma) was inversely correlated with age (r = -0.46, P = 0.025). Plasma lithium did not correlate with any clinical outcome, lithium dosage or adverse effects. ConclusionThese findings suggest that non-remitters may not transport lithium properly to the brain, which may underlie treatment resistance to lithium in BD. Future studies with Li-7-MRS integrated with the evaluation of blood-brain barrier transport mechanisms and longitudinal clinical outcomes in BD and aging are warranted.","2016-03","2018-12-21 17:52:08","2018-12-21 17:52:08","","214-220","","3","133","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; depression; imaging; lithium; magnetic resonance spectroscopy; spectroscopy; treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ResultsThe stress model proved to be a good fit to the data. The results showed that a mediating variable - a problem-centred coping strategy - transmitted the effect of stress variables such as recognition of ageing, establishment of permanency planning, and worries about the future on caregiving satisfaction. The relationship of adult children with intellectual disability also transmitted the effect of establishment of permanency planning on caregiving satisfaction.

The sample included Latinos (N = 2,554) from the National Latino and Asian American Study. Path analysis revealed that among the total sample, greater exposure to everyday discrimination was associated with higher levels of family cultural conflict and, in turn, increased psychological distress. Multiple-group path analysis revealed no effect modification by gender.

Women and men who varied in objective body weight (body mass index; BMI) gave a speech describing why they would make a good date. Half believed that a potential dating partner would see a videotape of their speech (weight seen) and half believed that a potential dating partner would listen to an audiotape of their speech (weight unseen). Among women, but not men, higher body-weight predicted increased expectations of social rejection, decreased executive control resources, decreased self-esteem, increased self-conscious emotions and behavioral displays of self-consciousness when weight was seen but not when weight was unseen. As predicted, higher body-weight women reported increased expectations of social rejection when weight was seen (versus unseen), which in turn predicted decreased self-esteem, increased self-conscious emotions, and increased stress. In contrast, lower body-weight women reported decreased expectations of social rejection when weight was seen (versus unseen), which in turn predicted increased self-esteem, decreased self-conscious emotions, and decreased stress. Men's responses were largely unaffected by body-weight or visibility, suggesting that a dating context may not be identity threatening for higher body-weight men. Overall, the present research illuminates a rejection expectation pathway by which weight stigma undermines higher body-weight women's health.

For survivors' wellbeing, it is key that these intrusions are controlled. Memory control can be exerted through retrieval suppression. Poor retrieval suppression, however, should be associated with persistent distressing intrusions and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study tested the hypothesis that individual differences in retrieval suppression predict intrusive memories after trauma. Retrieval suppression was examined with the think/no-think task (TNT) using behavioral and event related potential (ERP) measures. Methods: Twenty-four healthy participants watched a “traumatic” film after performing the TNT task. The frequency and distress of intrusions from the “traumatic” film was measured with an electronic diary. Additionally the Impact of Event Scale (IES) was assessed. Results: In line with our hypothesis, behavioral measures of retrieval suppression ability predicted reduced distress ratings for intrusions (r=.53, p<.01). Further ERP markers of retrieval suppression (a fronto-centrally distributed N2) predicted reduced distress ratings for intrusions (r=.45, p<.05) and reduced IES Intrusion scores (r=.56, p<.01). Limitations: The presented film is a relatively mild stressor as compared to a real-life trauma. Further studies are needed to explore the role of memory control processes for real-life trauma. Conclusions: Participants with lower retrieval suppression ability exhibited less distressing intrusive memories after analogue trauma. The ERP correlate of retrieval suppression was associated with less distressing intrusive memories and reduced IES Intrusion scores, suggesting that deficient memory control is a potential risk factor for developing PTSD.

We tested the hypothesis that in middle childhood a unifunctional conception of artists' intention to produce a picture widens to include artists' intention to display their pictures to others. Children aged between 5 and 10 years viewed a brief video of an artist deliberately hiding her picture but her intention was thwarted when her picture was discovered and displayed. By 8 years of age children were almost unanimous that a picture-producer without an intention to show her work to others cannot be considered to be an artist. Further exploratory studies centered on aspects of picture-display involving normal public display as well as the contrary intentions of hiding an original picture and of deceitfully displaying a forgery. Interviews suggested that the concept of exhibition widened to take others' minds into account viewers' critical judgments and effects of forgeries on viewers' minds. The approach of interpolating probes of typical possibilities between atypical intentions generated evidence that in middle childhood the foundations are laid for a conception of communication between artists' minds and viewers' minds via pictorial display. The combination of hypothesis-testing and exploratory opening-up of the area generates a new testable hypothesis about how an increasingly mentalistic approach enables children to understand diverse possibilities in the pictorial domain.","2016-02-26","2018-12-21 17:52:11","2018-12-21 17:52:11","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","artworks; exhibition; forgery; intention; pictorial theory; representation; theory of mind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously we reported that repeated intermittent D-amphetamine administration can lead to progressively greater dopamine release, thereby providing evidence of drug-induced neurochemical sensitization. Here, we test the hypothesis that repeated exposure to D-amphetamine increases dopaminergic responses to stress; that is, produces cross-sensitization. Using positron emission tomography, we measured in 17 healthy male volunteers (mean +/- s.d. = 22.1 +/- 3.4 years) [C-11]raclopride binding responses to a validated psychosocial stress task before and 2 weeks after a regimen of repeated D-amphetamine (3 x 0.3 mg kg(-1), by mouth; n = 8) or placebo (3 x lactose, by mouth; n = 9). Mood and physiological measurements were recorded throughout each session. Before the D-amphetamine regimen, exposure to the stress task increased behavioral and physiological indices of stress (anxiety, heart rate, cortisol, all P <= 0.05). Following the D-amphetamine regimen, the stress-induced cortisol responses were augmented (P < 0.04), and voxel-based analyses showed larger stress-induced decreases in [11C] raclopride non-displaceable binding potential across the striatum. In the placebo group, re-exposure to stress led to smaller clusters of decreased [C-11]raclopride binding, primarily in the sensorimotor striatum (P < 0.05). Together, this study provides evidence for drug x stress cross-sensitization; moreover, random exposure to stimulants and/or stress cumulatively, while enhancing dopamine release in striatal areas, may contribute to a lowered set point for psychopathologies in which altered dopamine neurotransmission is invoked.","2016-02-23","2018-12-21 17:52:12","2018-12-21 17:52:12","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when presented with a conjoined-subject intransitive frame and Y are Ving), participants (even adults, as we show) are at chance. Although in some instances, children older than three can obtain above-chance-level performance, these experiments still appear to rely upon a within-experiment contrast with the transitive frame. This leads us to ask whether children can achieve success with the intransitive frame without such a contrast among constructions, and map a novel verb appearing in such a frame onto a non-causative meaning. Building on recent evidence that adverbial modifiers can support word learning for adjectives and for verbs (when both nominal and verbal candidate interpretations are considered) by directing children to a particular construal of a scene, we test the hypothesis that a semantically informative modifier, together, will provide children with additional lexical information that allows them to narrow down verb meaning and identify a non-causative interpretation for a novel verb appearing in the conjoined-subject intransitive frame. We find that for English-speaking children and adults it does, but only when together directly modifies the verb phrase, suggesting that participants appeal to compositionality and not just the brute addition of another word, even one that is semantically meaningful, to arrive at the intended interpretation. Children acquiring Mandarin Chinese, in contrast, do not succeed with the translation-equivalent of together (although adult speakers do), but they do with dou (roughly, the distributive quantifier “each”). Our results point to a valuable source of information young children learning verbs: modifiers with familiar semantics.","2016-02-16","2018-12-21 17:52:13","2018-12-21 17:52:13","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adverbs; conjoined-subject intransitive; distributivity; lexical semantics; Mandarin Chinese; modification; syntactic bootstrapping; verb learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: An observational, prospective, longitudinal study of mental illness in pregnancy was conducted at a university-based women's mental health clinic (April 2010-November 2012). A sample of 178 mother-child dyads participated in a laboratory visit at preschool age (2.5-5.5 years). The majority of women (87%) received psychotropic medication during pregnancy. Psychiatric status (based on DSM-IV), other medication use, and substance use were serially assessed and tested as confounds. Primary outcome measures included standardized measures of expressive language and cognitive function and mother and alternate caregiver ratings of child behavior problems, including the Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: Linear regression analyses revealed that, after controlling for relevant covariates, expressive language scores from the Test of Early Language Development, 3rd edition, were negatively associated with prenatal SRI exposure (beta = -0.15, t = -2.41), while the PDD behavioral problems subscales completed by alternate caregivers and mothers were positively associated with prenatal SRI exposure (beta = 0.17, t = 2.01; beta = 0.16, t = 2.00, respectively). Cognitive function, measured using the Differential Ability Scales, 2nd edition, was not associated with any medication exposures. Conclusions: The current data suggest a small but significant association between prenatal SRI exposure and preschool outcomes, including expressive language and behavior problems. These data corroborate data from recent, population-based studies, although overall, published findings are mixed. Replication and identification of moderating risk factors are needed to understand potential clinical implications.

Specifically, it aims to test the hypothesis that children with high/stable CP differentiated on CU traits score on opposite directions on a fear-fearless continuum. Seventy-three participants (M age = 11.21; 45.2% female) were selected from a sample of 1,200 children. Children and their parents completed a battery of questionnaires assessing fearfulness, sensitivity to punishment, and behavioral inhibition. Children also participated in an experiment assessing their startle reactivity to fearful mental imagery, a well-established index of defensive motivation. The pattern of results verifies the hypothesis that fearlessness, assessed with physiological and behavioral measures, is a core characteristic of children high on both CP and CU traits (i.e., receiving the DSM-5 specifier of limited prosocial emotions). To the contrary, children with high/stable CP and low CU traits demonstrated high responsiveness to fear, high behavioral inhibition, and high sensitivity to punishment. The study is in accord with the principle of equifinality, in that different developmental mechanisms (i.e., extremes of high and low fear) may have the same behavioral outcome manifested as phenotypic antisocial behavior.","2016-02","2018-12-21 17:52:15","2018-12-21 17:52:15","","185-198","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children (N = 161) with and without ADHD were evaluated 3 times: parent and teacher temperament ratings and NEPSY visual attention at ages 3-4 years; Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-4th edition Working Memory Index and NEPSY Response Set at age 6 years; and ADHD symptoms using the Kiddie-SADS at age 7 years.

Bootstrapping was used to determine whether age 6 executive functioning mediated the relation between early anger/frustration and later ADHD symptom severity, while controlling for early executive functioning. Preschoolers' anger/frustration was significantly associated with later ADHD symptoms, with this relation partially mediated by age 6 executive functioning.

Method: Older participants (n = 1,965) in 3 longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies who had no cognitive impairment at baseline underwent annual clinical evaluations for a mean of 8.0 years (SD = 5.0). The authors defined depression diagnostically, as major depression during the study period, and psychometrically, as elevated depressive symptoms during the study period, and established their relation to cognitive outcomes (incident dementia, rate of cognitive decline).

Recent literature suggests that both non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) can also be conceptualized as addictions. The major aim of this mini review is to review the literature and explore the neurobiological and psychological mechanisms underlying the addiction to self-harming behaviors. Method: This is a narrative review. The authors performed literature searches in PubMed and Google for suicidal behavior, self-harming, addiction, and “major repeaters.” Given the scarce literature on the topic, a subset of the most closely related studies was selected. The authors also focused on three empirical studies testing the hypothesis that major repeaters (individuals with >= 5 lifetime suicide attempts) represent a distinctive suicidal phenotype and are the individuals at risk of developing an addiction to SB. Results: The authors reviewed the concept of behavioral addictions and major repeaters, current empirical evidence testing concerning whether or not NSSI and SB can be understood as “addictions,” and the putative mechanisms underlying them. Conclusion: Our review suggests that both NSSI and SB can be conceptualized as addictions. This is relevant because if some individual's self-harming behaviors are better conceptualized as an addiction, treatment approaches could be tailored to this addiction.","2016-02-01","2018-12-21 17:52:17","2018-12-21 17:52:17","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","addiction; dopamine; non-suicidal self-injury; opioid; stress; suicidal behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are associated with difficulties in recognising others' emotions, and in regulating own emotions. We tested the hypothesis that, in people with ASC, such affective differences may arise from abnormalities in interoceptive processing. We demonstrated that individuals with ASC have reduced interoceptive accuracy (quantified using heartbeat detection tests) and exaggerated interoceptive sensibility (subjective sensitivity to internal sensations on self-report questionnaires), reflecting an impaired ability to objectively detect bodily signals alongside an over-inflated subjective perception of bodily sensations. The divergence of these two interoceptive axes can be computed as a trait prediction error. This error correlated with deficits in emotion sensitivity and occurrence of anxiety symptoms. Our results indicate an origin of emotion deficits and affective symptoms in ASC at the interface between body and mind, specifically in expectancy-driven interpretation of interoceptive information.

The basic cognitive mechanisms associated with attention biases in youth, however, remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that threat bias (selective attention for threatening versus neutral stimuli) but not sad bias relies on stimulus-driven attention. We collected measures of stimulus-driven attention, threat bias, sad bias, and current clinical symptoms in youth with a history of an anxiety disorder and/or depression (ANX/DEP; n = 40) as well as healthy controls (HC; n = 33). Stimulus-driven attention was measured with a non-emotional spatial orienting task, while threat bias and sad bias were measured at a short time interval (150 ms) with a spatial orienting task using emotional faces and at a longer time interval (500 ms) using a dot-probe task. In ANX/DEP but not HC, early attention bias towards threat was negatively correlated with later attention bias to threat, suggesting that early threat vigilance was associated with later threat avoidance. Across all subjects, stimulus-driven orienting was not correlated with early threat bias but was negatively correlated with later threat bias, indicating that rapid stimulus-driven orienting is linked to later threat avoidance. No parallel relationships were detected for sad bias. Current symptoms of depression but not anxiety were related to decreased stimulus-driven attention. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that threat bias but not sad bias relies on stimulus-driven attention.

It has two aims: (1) to test the hypothesis of a direct effect of habits on offences (i.e., independent of intentions) by employing a specific measure of habits (i.e., the SRIH) and (2) to analyse the offences by taking account of three distinct parameters: Frequency, usual magnitude (i.e., the most frequent deviation from the law) and maximal magnitude (i.e., the greatest deviation occasionally adopted) in order to represent more accurately the variability of the offending behaviours. A total of 642 drivers replied to a questionnaire. The results corroborate the idea that intention and habit are distinct and direct determinants of offences. The use of the SRIH dismisses the criticisms made with regard to the measure of past behaviour. The distinction between the three behavioural parameters proves to be relevant, as their determinants are not exactly similar. Finally, attitude and subjective norm had direct effects on the maximal magnitude and/or on the frequency of the offence. The discussion concerns the contribution of this study to the analysis of offences as well as its limitations and addresses the theoretical plausibility of the direct effects of attitude and the subjective norm.","2016-02","2018-12-21 17:52:20","2018-12-21 17:52:20","","52-71","","1","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attitude; behavioural intention; drinking and driving; Self-Reported Index of Habit strength; speeding; traffic offences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insights from the molecular cascades","JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS","","0165-0327","10.1016/j.jad.2015.10.016","","Bipolar Disorder is a severe disease characterized by pathological mood swings from major depressive episodes to manic ones and vice versa. The biological underpinnings of Bipolar Disorder have yet to be defined. As a consequence, pharmacological treatments are suboptimal. In the present paper we test the hypothesis that the molecular pathways involved with the direct targets of lithium, hold significantly more genetic variations associated with BD. A molecular pathway approach finds its rationale in the polygenic nature of the disease. The pathways were tested in a sample of 7000 patients and controls. Data are available from the public NIMH database. The definition of the pathways was conducted according to the National Cancer Institute (hilp://pid.nci.nih.gov/). As a result, 3 out of the 18 tested pathways related to lithium action resisted the permutation analysis and were found to be associated with BD. These pathways were related to Reelin, Integrins and Aurora. A pool of genes selected from the ones linked with the above pathways was further investigated in order to identify the fine molecular mechanics shared by our significant pathways and also their link with lithium mechanism of action. The data obtained point out to a possible involvement of microtubule-related mechanics. (C) 2015 Elsevier By.

Psychological stress may contribute to develop CVD in IR, although mechanisms are poorly understood. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that individuals with IR have enhanced emotional and physiological responses to acute psychological stress, leading to increased CVD risk. Sixty participants were enrolled into the study, and classified into IR group (n = 31) and insulin sensitive group (n = 29) according to the Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, which was calculated based on an oral glucose tolerance test. The Trier social stress test, a standardized experimental stress paradigm, was performed on each participant, and emotional and physiological responses were examined. Blood was collected from each subject for insulin, cytokines, and cortisol measurements. Compared with the insulin-sensitive group, individuals with IR had significantly lower ratings of energy and calm, but higher fatigue levels in response to acute stressors. Individuals with IR also showed blunted heart rate reactivity following stress. In addition, the IR status was worsened by acute psychological stress as demonstrated by further increased insulin secretion. Furthermore, individuals with IR showed significantly increased levels of leptin and interleukin-6, but decreased levels of adiponectin, at baseline, stress test, and post-stress period. Our findings in individuals with IR under acute stress would allow a better understanding of the risks for developing CVD and to tailor the interventions for better outcomes.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:22","2018-12-21 17:52:22","","585-592","","6","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Acute psychological stress; cardiovascular disease; cortisol; cytokines; insulin resistance; risk factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that how mothers orient their attention to their offspring is linked to differences in offspring's attachment style. Additionally, we tested whether this association depended on which emotions children express. 29 mothers participated with their offspring (48.3% girls; ages 9 to 15 years, M = 10.93, SD = 1.67). Across two experimental blocks, eye movements were recorded as mothers viewed photographs of offspring and unfamiliar children showing neutral (block 1) and facial expressions of fearful, happy and sad (block 2). Offspring's self-reported attachment anxiety was related to increased maintained attention of the mother on the offspring's neutral face, while more attachment security was related to reduced maintained attention. With regard to emotional faces, mothers of more anxiously attached children showed more maintained attention on all emotional expressions of their offspring, including sadness. Furthermore, we found a positive attentional bias of mothers with more securely attached children; increased attention on the offspring's happy face was found. No attentional processes were found for attachment avoidance. Different attachment-related parenting behaviors, leading to a specific attachment style of the offspring, could be explained by these attentional allocations. (C) Copyright 2016 Textrum Ltd.

To date, however, the dimension of cognitive variability that enables the effective execution of this emotionally beneficial attentional strategy remains unknown. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the capacity to effectively attentionally avoid negative social information will be more evident in children and adolescents who exhibit higher levels of inhibitory attentional control, relative to those who display lower levels of inhibitory attentional control. Specifically, we recruited 115 children (aged 11 - 14 years old) from two public schools in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, who varied widely in terms of their social anxiety vulnerability, as assessed by the Social Phobia subscale of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale. These children completed a novel attentional assessment task designed to provide measures of both inhibitory attentional control, and attentional bias to negative social information. In keeping with the hypothesis under test, our present findings show that the association between social anxiety vulnerability and attentional avoidance of negative social information was indeed more evident in socially anxious children and adolescents with higher levels of inhibitory attentional control. We discuss ways in which future investigators could build upon the present findings to further shed light on the cognitive factors that contribute to vulnerability and resistance to developing social anxiety.

More specifically, the aim was to test the hypotheses of retrieval effort and transfer appropriate processing by comparing retention tests with respect to practice testing format. To adequately compare SA and MC items, the MC items were corrected for random guessing. With a within-group design, 54 students (mean age=16years) first read a short text, and took four practice tests containing all three formats (SA, MC and statements to read) with feedback provided after each part. The results showed that both MC and SA formats improved short- and long-term memory compared to rereading.

Similar phenomena have been reported for sensory and other processing (e.g. [Helson (1964). Adaptation-level theory. NewYork: Harper & Row; Stevens, and Greenbaum (1966). Regression effect in psychophysical judgment. Perception & Psychophysics, 1, 439-446]. Performance feedback (knowledge of results) does not correct this performance distortion although it does correct other errors. In Experiment 1, I tested the hypothesis that a random presentation order of the standard durations makes feedback on one trial inappropriate for the next trial preventing correction of the Vierordt effect. In Experiment 2, participants performed two consecutive reproductions after each standard duration. Having the opportunity to immediately utilize the feedback from the first reproduction did not eliminate the Vierordt effect, although participants did attempt to correct the error on the first reproduction. In Experiment 3, the Vierordt effect was reduced in a blocked presentation design. Feedback produced more veridical performance. I conclude that the resistance of the Vierordt effect to correction by feedback may result, in part, from feedback on a given trial being misapplied to correcting performance on the next trial. Ironically, the Vierordt effect, which produced the differing directions and magnitudes of performance errors reported by the feedback, may be what prevents feedback from correcting for the Vierordt effect.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:25","2018-12-21 17:52:25","","948-964","","8","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","feedback; knowledge of results; memory mixing; timing; Vierordts Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 76 MS accounting students volunteered to participate in an experiment. A between-subjects experimental design was used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The experimental evidence suggests that individuals, while using high-complexity heuristics, can choose an incorrect PM when PM attribute conflict is present and the difference between PM attribute differences is small. Individuals with high goal commitment are more likely to make the correct choice than individuals with low goal commitment, because they focus more on the PMs' goal congruence than on the PMs' noise when making tradeoffs between the conflicting PMs' attributes.

Delay discounting involves devaluing larger, later rewards in favor of smaller, more immediate rewards. The constant novelty and primacy of sexual stimuli as particularly strong natural rewards make Internet pornography a unique activator of the brain's reward system, thereby having implications for decision-making processes. Based on theoretical studies of evolutionary psychology and neuroeconomics, two studies tested the hypothesis that consuming Internet pornography would relate to higher rates of delay discounting. Study 1 used a longitudinal design. Participants completed a pornography use questionnaire and a delay discounting task at Time 1 and then again four weeks later. Participants reporting higher initial pornography use demonstrated a higher delay discounting rate at Time 2, controlling for initial delay discounting. Study 2 tested for causality with an experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to abstain from either their favorite food or pornography for three weeks. Participants who abstained from pornography use demonstrated lower delay discounting than participants who abstained from their favorite food. The finding suggests that Internet pornography is a sexual reward that contributes to delay discounting differently than other natural rewards.

Most evidence for this comes from visual search tasks in which a distractor similar to the memory interferes with the detection of a simultaneous target. Here we provide additional evidence using one of the most popular paradigms in the literature for demonstrating an active attentional set: The contingent spatial orienting paradigm of Folk and colleagues. This paradigm allows memory-based attentional biases to be more directly attributed to spatial orienting. Experiment 1 demonstrated a memory-contingent spatial attention effect for colour but not for shape contents of VWM. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that the placeholders used for spatial cueing interfered with the shape processing, and showed that memory-based attentional capture for shape returned when placeholders were removed. The results of the present study are consistent with earlier findings from distractor interference paradigms, and provide additional evidence that biases in spatial orienting contribute to memory-based influences on attention.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:32","2018-12-21 17:52:32","","51-62","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attentional capture; attentional set; Visual search; working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we predict that perceiving insufficient organizational change communication may result in rumours, which in turn may shape job insecurity perceptions. Second, we propose that rumours may also mediate the relationship between job insecurity and perceiving insufficient organizational change communication. To test the hypotheses, a multilevel approach was used, in which three measurements were nested within 1994 employees. This enabled us to probe within-person processes, while controlling for possible between-person variation. The results demonstrated a negative reciprocal relationship between perceived organizational change communication and job insecurity. Additionally, rumours mediated both the negative relationship between perceived organizational change communication and subsequent job insecurity, and the negative relationship between job insecurity and subsequent perceived organizational change communication. This study contributes to the literature on job insecurity by offering initial evidence on the relationship between job insecurity and rumours, and by highlighting rumours as a process through which perceived organizational change communication and job insecurity may mutually affect each other.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:33","2018-12-21 17:52:33","","631-644","","5","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","job insecurity; multilevel mediation; organizational change communication; rumours; within-person","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a sample of 93 adolescents and adults with or without histories of child sexual abuse (CSA), we tested the hypothesis that nonspecific memory retrieval is related to an individual's general tendency to use avoidant (i.e., distancing) coping as a personal problem-solving or coping strategy, especially in victims of CSA. We also examined age differences and other individual differences (e.g., trauma-related psychopathology) as predictors of nonspecific memories. Distancing coping was significantly associated with less specific autobiographical memory. Younger age, lower vocabulary scores, and non-CSA childhood maltreatment (i.e., physical and emotional abuse) also uniquely predicted less autobiographical memory specificity, whereas trauma-related psychopathology was associated with more specific memory. Implications for the development of autobiographical memory retrieval in the context of coping with childhood maltreatment are discussed.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:34","2018-12-21 17:52:34","","1078-1090","","8","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; adults; child sexual abuse; Memory; overgeneral memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, we tested the hypothesis that rumination acts as a mediator variable for the effect of age and gender on depression scores. Differences in rumination, problem solving, distraction, autobiographical recall and depression were assessed in a group of young adults (18-29 years) compared to a group of older adults (50-76 years). The older group used more problem solving and distraction strategies when in a depressed state than their younger counterparts (ps < .05). The younger participants reported more rumination (p < .01). Women scored higher in depression scores and lower in distraction than men (ps < .05). There were no significant effects of age, gender, or interaction of age by gender on the recall of specific autobiographical memories (ps > .06). Ordinary least squares regression analyses with bootstrapping showed that rumination mediated the association between age, gender and depression scores.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 117 actively employed business graduate students completed a self-report measure of RS and identified two close associates, one of which completed an observer version of the Brown Attention Deficit Scale while the other complete an observer version of a TM measure. Product moment correlations were used to test the hypotheses that AAD, TM and RS were associated. The Sobel test of mediation was used to test the hypothesis that TM mediated the relationship between AAD and RS. Findings - AAD, TM and RS are associated with each other and TM partially mediates the relationship between AAD and RS. Research limitations/implications - Research study is limited by a measure of AAD that may not fully represent all the key symptom clusters and an indirect workplace sample. Further investigation of AAD symptoms, including potentially positive manifestations like entre/intrapreneurial cognition and behavior, is required to stabilize the content, structure and measurement of the construct. Practical implications - Organizations wishing to ensure timely completion of tasks and limit disruptive RS need to be aware of the influence of AAD. The provision of TM training, productivity management tools and an organized work space free of distractions is suggested for disordered employees. Various forms of organizational coaching including a peer coaching system may help disordered employees better manage both their time and their role. The effective design and management of teams represents a significant opportunity for effectively distributing the potential benefits of the disorder while managing deficits like poor TM and increased RS. Organizational development interventions that focus on TM and role (re) negotiation are suggested. Employee assistance programs that raise awareness and provide access to assessment are an important part of multimodal management of the disorder. Social implications - Increasing social, economic and legal pressures to provide reasonable accommodation for functional but disordered employees and take appropriate advantage of employee diversity underscores the general social value of this research. Originality/value - This research study is the first empirical examination of the mediating influence of TM on the relationship between AAD and RS. The results are of value to researchers, organizational development specialists, human resource management specialists, managers and employees who are seeking effective multimodal management of the disorder in the workplace.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:35","2018-12-21 17:52:35","","681-706","","4","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive style; Competencies; Diversity; Equality; Human resource development; Inclusion; Individual behaviour; Individual performance; Quantitative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Experiment 1 we associated expressions of anger and happiness with specific proportions of congruent/incongruent flanker trials. We also created consistent and inconsistent category members within each of these two general contexts. The results demonstrated that participants exhibited a larger congruency effect when presented with faces in the emotional group associated with a high proportion of congruent trials.

These attitudes may contribute to suboptimal general medical care for patients with schizophrenia. This study tested the hypothesis that provider contact (personal and professional) with persons with mental illness would be associated with clinical expectations and that this relationship would be mediated by provider stigmatizing attitudes. Methods: Between August 2011 and April 2012, 192 health care providers from five Veterans Affairs medical centers responded to a clinical vignette describing a patient with schizophrenia who is seeking treatment for back pain. Providers completed a survey to determine their expectations regarding the vignette patient's treatment adherence, ability to read and understand health education materials, and social and vocational functioning. Self-report data on the amount of contact each provider had with persons with mental illness in their practices and in their personal lives were also collected. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that providers with greater professional contact with patients with mental illness in their clinical practice and greater personal contact with individuals with mental illness exhibited significantly lower stigmatizing attitudes toward the patient with schizophrenia in the vignette and were more likely to expect the vignette patient to have better treatment adherence, a better understanding of educational material, and higher social and vocational functioning. Conclusions: Greater personal and professional contact with persons with mental illness was associated with lower provider stigma and higher expectations of patient adherence, increased ability to understand educational material, and higher social and vocational functioning. It is possible that interventions involving contact with persons with mental illness could reduce providers' stigma.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:52:38","2018-12-21 17:52:38","","55-61","","1","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 232 leader-follower dyads from ten companies in China. Polynomial regression combined with the response surface methodology was used to test the hypotheses. Findings - Four conclusions were drawn. First, leader-member exchange (LMX) was higher when leaders and followers were aligned in terms of workplace loneliness than otherwise. Second, in the case of leader-follower congruence, LMX rose as their workplace loneliness fell. Third, in the case of incongruence, followers had lower LMX when they were lonelier than their leaders.

This study examines the impact of one such moderator, testing the hypothesis that the magnitude of the association between intention and behaviour decreases as the temporal separation between the two increases. A systematic literature search was used to identify published and unpublished studies that met the inclusion criteria. A random-effects meta-regression was conducted to test the study hypothesis. A total of 78 journal articles and 11 unpublished dissertations were identified, yielding 109 effect sizes. The mean number of weeks between the measurement of intention and behaviour was 5.4 (SD = 6.6, range =.43, 26). The average correlation between intention and behaviour was r = 0.51. In line with theoretical predictions, temporal separation was a significant moderator of the intention-behaviour correlation (B = -.014, p <.001) and explained 24% of the between-study variance.

Furthermore, the importance of gain and loss cycles (i.e. recursive effects) for the desired retirement age was investigated. Design/methodology/approach - A two wave full panel design with 2,897 older employees (>50) served to test the hypotheses. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the measurement and research model. Cross-lagged analyses tested the presence of gain and loss cycles. Findings - Results from cross-lagged analyses based on two waves over a one-year period indicated the presence of both a gain and a loss cycle that affected the desired retirement age. Research limitations/implications - This is the first longitudinal study applying the JD-R model to a retirement context. Limitations relate to employing only two waves for establishing mediation, and using self-reports. Practical implications - Because work conditions can create a cycle of motivation as well as a cycle of depletion, organizations should pay special attention to the job resources and demands of older workers. The findings can inspire organizations when developing active aging policies, and contribute to interventions aimed at maintaining older employees within the workforce until - or even beyond - their official retirement age in a motivated and healthy way.

Design/methodology/approach - Multigroup structural equation analysis was used to test the hypotheses in two cross-sectional Chinese samples of 463 police officers and 261 nurses. Findings - Results supported the distinction between social resources and task resources. Social resources were positively related to engagement and organizational commitment (for police officers), task resources were positively related to engagement (for both nurses and police officers), organizational commitment (for police officers), and negatively to burnout (for police officers). Guanxi exchange with supervisors was positively associated with social resources (for both nurses and police officers), task resources (for nurses), and organizational commitment (for police officers). Moreover, guanxi exchange was positively related with work engagement in both nurses and police officers. Unexpectedly, guanxi exchange was positively related with burnout in police officers. Research limitations/implications - Due to its cross-sectional design, longitudinal replication of the findings is desirable in order to establish causality. Practical implications - The effects of informal interpersonal relations (i.e. guanxi exchange) on employees' well-being and organizational commitment should be acknowledged, especially when developing strategies to reduce burnout and increase work engagement.

Findings - The results partially support the idea that perceived and objective value congruence moderate the relationship of race/ethnic and gender dissimilarity on workplace attachment. Tests for asymmetrical demographic group effects showed that value congruence had a stronger moderating effect for whites than for people of color, and for men than for women. Research limitations/implications - The results suggest that value congruence can ameliorate the adverse diversity effects on workplace attachment, but that a complete substitution effect may not be present. Women and minorities may still be sensitive to demographic representation even when their value congruence is high. This implies that a simultaneous pursuit of fit and diversity is an adequate diversity management strategy to stimulate the inclusion and workplace attachment of all social groups. Originality/value - This study joins a limited number of studies addressing the interaction of value congruence and demographic dissimilarity, and presents empirical evidence from a work setting. Also, this is the first study to show gender and race/ethnic differences in this interaction.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:46","2018-12-21 17:52:46","","169-185","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Diversity; Gender; Optimal distinctiveness; Race/ethnicity; Relational demography; Value congruence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal survey method was used to collect data from downsizing survivors in two phases. The final sample was 281 cases. Confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical regression models were used to test the hypotheses. Findings - PCV is positively related to turnover intention, and the relationship is moderated by cultural value orientations. Specifically, the relationship is stronger among downsizing survivors with a high level of subjugation orientation (SO) and/or a low level of mastery orientation (MO) in comparison with downsizing survivors with a low level of SO and/or a high level of MO. Research limitations/implications - The contribution of the study lies in the utility of examining culture at an individual level of analysis in relation to PC and downsizing research. Despite a generic human functioning model, some subtle cultural influences exist affecting the processes within the model. The negative reactions to downsizing are not simply a function of situational factors, but also reflect individual differences in cultural value orientations. Originality/value - The study addresses the need to examine the role of cultural value orientations in influencing the relationship between PCV, and employee behaviors. Such an examination is important because cultural differences may result in unique interpretations and reactions to PCV.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:47","2018-12-21 17:52:47","","251-264","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cultural value orientations; Downsizing; Malaysia; Mastery; Psychological contract violation; Subjugation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using a two-wave survey research design. Participants were drawn from 360 supervisor-subordinate dyads from mainland China. Hierarchical regression analyses, Edwards and Lambert's (2007) moderated path analysis approach, and Preacher et al.'s (2010) Monte Carlo simulation procedure were used to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings - LMX mediated the positive relationship between proactive personality and career success. Both the relationship between LMX and career success and the indirect relationship between proactive personality and career success were stronger when power distance orientation was lower. Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to the authors' understanding of how and when proactive personality facilitates employee career success in the era of the boundaryless career. However, all data were collected within a single organization, which limits the observed variability and decreases external validity. Practical implications - Training employees to facilitate initiative in the workplace may build and maintain better and stronger relationships with their supervisors. To enhance person-organization fit, organizations should recruit and hire employees with lower levels of power distance orientation. Originality/value - This study provides solid evidence that the extent to which LMX mediates the relationship between proactive personality and career success depends on power distance orientation. It represents a promising new direction for the proactive personality and career success literatures.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:48","2018-12-21 17:52:48","","467-482","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Career success; LMX; Power distance orientation; Proactive personality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - Data were requested from 225 employees in several Dutch organizations, of which 156 questionnaires were returned. The authors used multilevel path analysis in MPlus to test the hypotheses, which allows for simultaneous estimation of different regression equations and for testing the significance of indirect effects. Findings - In line with the hypotheses, results revealed a direct relationship between ethical leadership and UPB when followers have little job autonomy. For followers high on job autonomy, the authors found that ethical leadership relates to UPB via organizational identification. Practical implications - It is advised to use ethical leadership with care when it focusses on reciprocity and identification. The results suggest that followers may be inclined to justify their unethical actions by appealing to the principle of higher loyalty - believing they are just doing what the organization wants them to do. Originality/value - Previous research has used social learning theory to show that ethical leadership is likely to stimulate and transfer ethical norms and behaviors. The current study however demonstrates the reciprocal and dark side of ethical leadership, as the authors found that ethical leadership can encourage UPB for followers with low job autonomy.","2016","2018-12-21 17:52:49","2018-12-21 17:52:49","","500-515","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Ethical leadership; Job autonomy; Social exchange theory; Social identity theory; Unethical pro-organizational behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to extend this literature by examining several correlates and consequences of four recovery experiences: psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, and control. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 290 nursing staff working in hospitals using a questionnaire study and well-established measures. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The results suggest that the four recovery experiences were, with one exception, positively and significantly correlated. Personal demographic variables (e.g. work status and level of education) had relationships with the use of particular recovery experiences. Passion was positively related to the use of mastery and control, while work intensity was negatively associated with the use of psychological detachment and relaxation. The use of particular recovery experiences was generally associated with lower intentions to quit and positive indicators of psychological well-being. Research limitations/implications - There are several implications for research and practice. Scholars can use the results to extend the theories such as the job demands-resources model, including the role of work intensity as job demands. At the organizational level, managers and leaders should consider supporting strategies that help employees recover after work.

The purpose of this papers is to present and test a model whereby engagement mediates the relationship between four HRM practices and quality of care and safety in two different occupational groups in healthcare, namely, nurses and administrative support workers. Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modeling was used to analyze questionnaire data collected by the National Health Service in the UK as part of their 2011 Staff Survey (n = 69,018). The authors tested the hypotheses for nurses and administrative support workers separately. Findings - Training, participation in decision making, opportunities for development, and communication were positively related to quality of care and safety via work engagement. The strength of the relationships was conditional on whether an employee was a nurse or administrative support worker. Originality/value - This is the first paper to examine the mediating role of engagement on the relationship between four relevant HRM practices in the healthcare context, and outcomes important to healthcare practitioners. The authors also add value to the HRM literature by being among the first to use the job demands resources model to explain the impact of HRM practices on performance outcomes.

In three cross-sectional studies (N = 1,403), we examined how the Dark Triad traits were correlated with measures of resource availability, harshness, and unpredictability in one's childhood and adulthood. The Dark Triad traits were correlated with self-reports of an unpredictable childhood when using both the Short Dark Triad and the Dirty Dozen measures. These effects were somewhat stronger in men than in women and were replicable across samples. We also replicated sex differences in the Dark Triad traits but found none for our measures of socioecological conditions.

Method: A group of women were recruited from the community and completed measures of eating disorder (ED) thoughts, negative self-beliefs, and parental bonding. Individual body mass indices (BMIs) were calculated. Results: One hundred and eighteen women completed the study. There was a relationship between parental bonding and higher BMI. As hypothesized, the relationship between parental bonding (as measured by maternal care, and paternal overprotection) and BMI appeared to be mediated by a range of ED thoughts, and some negative self-beliefs.

Although discussions of historical loss and related constructs (e.g., historical trauma) are widespread within the Indigenous literature, empirical efforts to understand the consequence of historical loss are limited, partially because of the lack of valid assessments. In this study we evaluated the longitudinal measurement properties of the Historical Loss Scale (HLS)-a standardized measure that was developed to systematically examine the frequency with which Indigenous individuals think about historical loss-among a sample of North American Indigenous adolescents. We also test the hypothesis that thoughts of historical loss can be psychologically distressing. Methods: Via face-to-face interviews, 636 Indigenous adolescents from a single cultural group completed the HLS and a measure of anxiety at 4 time-points, which were separated by 1- to 2-year intervals (M age = 12.09 years, SD = .86, 50.0% girls at baseline). Results: Responses to the HLS were explained well by 3-factor (i.e., cultural loss, loss of people, and cultural mistreatment) and second-order factor structures. Both of these factor structures held full longitudinal metric (i.e., factor loadings) and scalar (i.e., intercepts) equivalence. In addition, using the second-order factor structure, more frequent thoughts of historical loss were associated with increased anxiety. Conclusions: The identified 3-factor and second-order HLS structures held full longitudinal measurement equivalence. Moreover, as predicted, our results suggest that historical loss can be psychologically distressing for Indigenous adolescents.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:52:52","2018-12-21 17:52:52","","1-10","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","historical loss; historical trauma; Indigenous adolescents; measurement equivalence/invariance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research with combat veterans has found anger to be related to psychological distress, psychosocial functioning, and harm risk variables. Using behavioral health data for 2,077 treatment-seeking soldiers who had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, this study examined whether anger disposition was intensified for those who met screen-threshold criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Anger was assessed with a 7-item screening measure previously validated with the study population. The study tested the hypothesis that anger would be highest when “PTSD & MDD” were conjoined, compared with “PTSD only,” “MDD only,” and “no PTSD, no MDD.” PTSD and depression were assessed with well-established screening instruments. A self-rated “wanting to harm others” variable was also incorporated. Age, gender, race, military component, military grade, and military unit social support served as covariates. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test the hypothesis, which was confirmed. Anger was intensified in the PTSD & MDD condition, in which it was significantly higher than in the other 3 conditions. Convergent support was obtained for “wanting to harm others” as an exploratory index. Given the high prevalence and co-occurrence of PTSD and MDD among veterans, the results have research and clinical practice relevance for systematic inclusion of anger assessment postdeployment from risk-assessment and screening standpoints.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:52:53","2018-12-21 17:52:53","","9-16","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anger; combat; depression; military; PTSD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to test the hypothesis that non-suicide death categories contain a large potential reservoir of misclassified suicides. Methods Data on undetermined intent and ill-defined death causes, and official suicide deaths recorded in the district of Tel Aviv for the years 2005 and 2008 were extracted. Based on supplementary data, cases regarded as probable suicides (”suicide probable”) were then compared with official suicides (”suicide verdicts”) on a number of socio-demographic variables, and also in relation to the mechanism of death. Results Suicide rates were 42 % higher than those officially reported after accounting for 75 probable suicides (erroneously certified under other cause-of-death categories). Both death classifications (”suicide probable” and “suicide verdicts”) had many similarities, significantly differing only with respect to method used. Logistic regression confirmed that the most powerful discriminator was whether the mechanism of death was considered “less active” or “more active” (p < 0.001). Indeed, deaths among the less active group were 4.9 times as likely to be classified as “suicide probable” than were deaths among the more active group. Conclusions Caution is needed when interpreting local area data on suicide rates, and undetermined and ill-defined deaths should be included in suicide research after excluding cases unlikely to be suicides. Improving suicide case ascertainment, using multiple sources of information, and uniform reporting practices, is advised.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:52:54","2018-12-21 17:52:54","","115-123","","1","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology of suicide; Suicide statistics; Suicide under-enumeration; Suicide validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 354 participants were 14- to 15-year-old students from affluent (56.8%) and disadvantaged (43.2%) Finnish lower secondary schools. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesis that a higher level of family-related identity capital is connected to a lower level of future worry, and that this connection is mediated through intrapersonal forms of identity capital, specifically academic self-concept and general self-efficacy. Adolescent future worry was also examined across school status with an independent samples t-test. The findings suggest that, in the relatively equal societal context in Finland, adolescents are rather confident about their future education, employment, and social status regardless of the socio-economic status of the school they attend, and when their level of identity capital is high the future worry decreases further.

After beverage administration, community women (n = 408) projected themselves into a scenario depicting a male partner exerting high or low pressure for unprotected sex. Mood, anticipated negative reactions from the partner, and condom-decision abdication were assessed. In both control and alcohol models, high pressure increased anticipated negative partner reaction, and positive mood was associated with increased abdication. In the alcohol model, victimization predicted abdication via anticipated negative partner reaction, and pressure decreased positive mood and abdication. In the control model, under high pressure, victimization history severity was positively associated with abdication. Findings implicate condom-decision abdication as an important construct in understanding how women's sexual victimization histories may exert sustained impact on sexual interactions.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:52:59","2018-12-21 17:52:59","","S134-S146","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alcohol; Condom decision abdication; Partner pressure; Sexual victimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sample of 82 lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults completed a measure of attachment style at the start of the study, and then reported on heterosexism experiences and facets of well-being in Internet surveys at the end of each day for 7-10 consecutive days (total of 706 days in the sample). Multilevel regression was used to test the interaction between attachment variables (anxiety and avoidance) and the presence of everyday heterosexism experiences in predicting 3 facets of daily well-being (self-assurance, anger, and fear). Results indicated that attachment variables moderated the within-person link between daily heterosexism experiences and well-being for anger and fear but not for self-assurance. As hypothesized, daily heterosexism was positively related to daily anger and fear for people with higher levels of avoidance but not those with lower levels of avoidance (controlling for previous day levels of well-being). Contrary to hypothesis, however, daily heterosexism was positively associated with anger and fear for participants with low levels of attachment anxiety but not for those with higher levels of attachment anxiety. Analyses also revealed no links between the attachment variables and frequency of heterosexism experiences.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:53:00","2018-12-21 17:53:00","","76-86","","1","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attachment; discrimination; LGB; prejudice; well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Variable patient responses and a wide range of side effects, however, limit their efficacy. Slow metabolizer status and gene variants in KCNH2 associated with increased expression of Kv11.1-3.1, an alternatively spliced isoform of Kv11.1, are correlated with improved responses to antipsychotic medications. Here, the authors test the hypothesis that these effects may be influenced by differential drug binding to Kv11.1 channel isoforms. Method: Drug block of Kv11.1 isoforms was tested in cellular electrophysiology assays. The effects of drug metabolism and KCNH2 genotypes on clinical responses were assessed in patients enrolled in the multicenter Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). Results: Risperidone caused greater in vitro block of the alternatively spliced Kv11.1-3.1 isoform than full-length Kv11.1-1A channels, whereas its metabolite paliperidone and other atypical antipsychotics have similar potencies for the two isoforms. In the CATIE study (N=362), patients with genotypes associated with increased Kv11.1-3.1 expression (N=52) showed a better treatment response to risperidone compared with other drugs, but this association was dependent on metabolism status. Patients with KCNH2 risk genotypes and slow metabotizer status (approximately 7% of patients) showed marked improvement in symptoms when treated with risperidone compared with patients with fast metabolizer status or without the KCNH2 risk genotypes. Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that Kv11.1 channels play a role in the therapeutic action of antipsychotic drugs, particularly risperidone, and further highlight the promise of optimizing response with genotype-guided therapy for schizophrenia patients.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:53:01","2018-12-21 17:53:01","","53-59","","1","173","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research investigated the interplay of sexual and non-sexual factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the association between sexual satisfaction and marital satisfaction is mediated by a non-sexual factor-namely, perceived partner responsiveness (PPR). Additionally, we tested the role of gender as a possible moderator of this mediated association. Thirty-four newlywed couples completed diaries with each spouse reporting their sexual satisfaction, marital satisfaction, and PPR every day for 30 days. We tested our predictions at both the person level (i.e., the mean level across 30 days) and the daily level. At the person level, we found that sexual satisfaction and PPR separately predicted marital satisfaction. Moreover, the effect of sexual satisfaction on marital satisfaction was partially mediated by PPR. No gender differences emerged at this level. At the daily level, we found similar support for partial mediation. However, at this level, gender did serve as a moderator. The stronger mediation found for women was driven by a stronger association between sexual satisfaction and PPR for women than for men. This study joins a growing literature highlighting the role of PPR in dyadic relationships.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:53:02","2018-12-21 17:53:02","","109-120","","1","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Daily diaries; Marital satisfaction; Perceived partner responsiveness; Sexual satisfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to test the hypothesis that the association between T gondii seropositivity and history of NF-SSDV would be stronger in schizophrenia patients with high plasma KYN levels than in those with lower KYN levels. We measured anti-T gondii IgG antibodies and plasma KYN in 950 patients with schizophrenia, and used logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between NF-SSDV and KYN in patients who were either seropositive or seronegative for T. gondii. For those with KYN levels in the upper 25th percentile, the unadjusted odds ratio for the association between NF-SSDV history and KYN in T gondii seropositive patients was 1.63 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.66), p = 0.048; the adjusted odds ratio was 1.95 (95% CI 1.15 to 3.30), p = 0.014. Plasma KYN was not associated with a history of NF-SSDV in T gondii seronegative patients. The results suggest that T. gondii and KYN may have a nonlinear cumulative effect on the risk of NF-SSDV among those with schizophrenia. If confirmed by future longitudinal studies, this result is expected to have both theoretical and clinical implications for the prevention and treatment of suicidal behavior.

We tested the hypothesis that these factors may have their basis in emotion regulation abilities. Our aim was to determine whether poor emotional control predicted long-term risk of CHD. Methods This Swedish national study includes 46,393 men who were conscripted for military service in 1969 and 1970. The men were aged 18 to 20 years at the time of conscription. Psychologists used a brief semistructured interview to retrospectively assess the conscripts' level of emotional control in childhood and adolescence. The outcome measure was a first fatal or nonfatal event of CHD. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for poor and adequate versus good emotional control. Results After 38 years of follow-up (1971-2009), 2456 incident cases of CHD had occurred. Poor emotional control increased the risk of CHD (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.18-1.45), adjusting for childhood socioeconomic position, anxiety, depression, and parental history of CHD. Further adjustment for life-style-related factors, for example, smoking and body mass index, attenuated the HR to 1.08 (95% CI = 0.97-1.21). In stratified analyses, the fully adjusted association between poor emotional control with CHD remained significantly elevated among men with a parental history of CHD (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.11-2.01, p interaction = .037). Conclusions In the overall study population, poor emotional control had no direct effect on CHD beyond life-style-related factors. However, in men with a parental history of CHD, poor emotional control in adolescence remained significantly predictive of long-term CHD risk even when adjusting for life-style-related factors.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:53:03","2018-12-21 17:53:03","","60-67","","1","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescence; coronary heart disease; emotion regulation; emotional control; parental history; psychosocial factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional models posit that scene categorization is achieved through recognizing necessary and sufficient features and objects, yet there is little consensus about what these may be. However, scene categories should reflect how we use visual information. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that scene categories reflect functions, or the possibilities for actions within a scene. Our approach is to compare human categorization patterns with predictions made by both functions and alternative models. We collected a large-scale scene category distance matrix (5 million trials) by asking observers to simply decide whether 2 images were from the same or different categories. Using the actions from the American Time Use Survey, we mapped actions onto each scene (1.4 million trials). We found a strong relationship between ranked category distance and functional distance (r = .50, or 66% of the maximum possible correlation). The function model outperformed alternative models of object-based distance (r = .33), visual features from a convolutional neural network (r = .39), lexical distance (r = .27), and models of visual features. Using hierarchical linear regression, we found that functions captured 85.5% of overall explained variance, with nearly half of the explained variance captured only by functions, implying that the predictive power of alternative models was because of their shared variance with the function-based model. These results challenge the dominant school of thought that visual features and objects are sufficient for scene categorization, suggesting instead that a scene's category may be determined by the scene's function.","2016-01","2018-12-21 17:53:07","2018-12-21 17:53:07","","82-94","","1","145","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","categorization; scene understanding; similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In three online studies (total N = 1069), participants completed a battery of tests scaled to assess sadism and the Dark Triad constructs, then faced different situations involving moral issues (attempted harm, intentional harm, accidental harm). Study 1 revealed that a sadistic personality trait was associated with minimization of the importance of harmful intent in moral judgment. Study 2 showed that a sadistic personality trait predicted minimization of the importance of causal mechanisms to harmful consequences in moral judgment. Study 3 showed that these effects were mediated by enjoyment of cruelty, a characteristic unique to sadists. In the light of Cushman's (2008) two-process model of moral judgment, this set of studies provides the first evidence that deficits in the integration of the theory of mind and causality can be observed in personality traits. The independent predictive value of sadism highlights that features other than emotional deficits are essential in explaining impaired moral evaluations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that these automated compiled procedures are restricted to small quantities that do not exceed the size of the focus of attention (i.e., 4 elements). For this purpose, we analyzed the response times of ninety adult participants when solving the 81 additions with operands from 1 to 9. Even when focusing on small problems (i.e. with sums reported by participants as being solved by direct retrieval, chronometric analyses revealed a strong size effect. Response times increased linearly with the magnitude of the operands testifying for the involvement of a sequential multistep procedure. However, this size effect was restricted to the problems involving operands from 1 to 4, whereas the pattern of response times for other small problems was compatible with a retrieval hypothesis. These findings suggest that very fast responses routinely interpreted as reflecting direct retrieval of the answer from memory actually subsume compiled automated procedures that are faster than retrieval and deliver their answer while the subject remains unaware of their process, mistaking them for direct retrieval from long-term memory.

It has not been shown, however, whether witnessing this counterattitudinal behavior arouses vicarious dissonance because it contradicts the attitudes of the observed ingroup member or for egocentric reasons - that is, because it contradicts the attitudes of the observer. In three experiments, we test the hypothesis that the conditions necessary for arousing vicarious dissonance-namely, observing an ingroup member's responsibility for aversive consequences and level of choice-are processed egocentrically by the observer. By manipulating perspective taking in a vicarious induced compliance task, and manipulating choice difficulty in a vicarious free-choice dissonance paradigm, we show that the arousal of vicarious dissonance crucially depends on the consequences of the ingroup member's actions for the observer, and not for the observed ingroup member. Implications for other aspects of vicarious dissonance and vicarious experience in general are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The results of an online study with 49 executives enrolled in an Executive MBA program confirmed the hypotheses.

The mechanism underlying this relation is not well understood, however. Self-compassion is a positive coping strategy that has been negatively related to post-trauma psychopathology in prior work. It was hypothesized that the external resource of social support increased the internal resource of self-compassion, which resulted in decreased psychopathology. The current study tested the hypothesis that the association between social support and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and depression symptoms had an indirect pathway via self-compassion. Using a,community sample of individuals exposed to potentially traumatic events, social support was positively related to self-compassion. Self-compassion was negatively related to PTSD, GAD, and depression symptoms. Self-compassion mediated the relation between social support and PTSD, GAD, and depression symptoms. These results suggest that social support may reduce symptoms of PTSD, GAD, and depression through increased self-compassion in those who experienced a trauma. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we test the hypothesis that the motion complexity individuals generate in their movements might be correlated to the degree of creativity assigned by a human observer to the visualized motion trajectories. We asked participants to generate 55 novel hand movement patterns in virtual reality, where each pattern had to be repeated 10 times in a row to ensure reproducibility. This allowed us to estimate a probability distribution over trajectories for each pattern. We assessed motion complexity not only by the previously proposed complexity measures on symbolic sequences, but we also propose two novel complexity measures that can be directly applied to the distributions over trajectories based on the frameworks of Gaussian Processes and Probabilistic Movement Primitives. In contrast to previous studies, these new methods allow computing complexities of individual motion patterns from very few sample trajectories. We compared the different complexity measures to how a group of independent jurors rank ordered the recorded motion trajectories according to their personal creativity judgment. We found three entropic complexity measures that correlate significantly with human creativity judgment and discuss differences between the measures. We also test whether these complexity measures correlate with individual creativity in divergent thinking tasks, but do not find any consistent correlation. Our results suggest that entropic complexity measures of hand motion may reveal domain-specific individual differences in kinesthetic creativity.","2015-12-17","2018-12-21 17:53:13","2018-12-21 17:53:13","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","creativity; Gaussian processes; Lempel-Ziv complexity; motion complexity; probabilistic movement primitives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sample of 291 patients, who presented with a first psychotic episode (ICD10 diagnoses F20-29 or F30-33) and in whom the rs1344706 genotype had been assayed, were followed to examine the duration of mental-health in-patient care during the 2 years following first service contact, as a primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures were whether or not an in-patient episode occurred and the number of in-patient episodes during this period. A strong association was found between the number of rs1344706 A alleles and the cumulative duration of mental-health in-patient stay over the 2 years since initial presentation. In the 84.2% who experienced an in-patient episode during this period, the mean duration of admission was an additional 38 days for each A allele increment.

The simplest and most prevalent method involves explicitly instructing participants to lie or tell the truth before presenting each task item. The usual finding of such experiments is increased cognitive load associated with deceptive responses, explained by necessity to inhibit default and automatic honest responses. However, explicit instructions are usually coupled with the absence of social context in the experimental task. Context plays a key role in social cognition by activating prior knowledge, which facilitates behaviors consistent with the latter. We hypothesized that in the presence of social context, both honest and deceptive responses can be produced on the basis of prior knowledge, without reliance on truth and without additional cognitive load during deceptive responses. In order to test the hypothesis, we have developed Speed-Dating Task (SDT), which is based on a real-life social event. In SDT, participants respond both honestly and deceptively to questions in order to appear similar to each of the dates. The dates are predictable and represent well-known categories (i.e., atheist or conservative). In one condition participants rely on explicit instructions preceding each question (external cue). In the second condition no explicit instructions are present, so the participants need to adapt based on prior knowledge about the category the dates belong to (internal cue). With internal cues, reaction times (RTs) are similar for both honest and deceptive responses. However, in the presence of external cues (EC), RTs are longer for deceptive than honest responses, suggesting that deceptive responses are associated with increased cognitive load. Compared to internal cues, deception costs were higher when EC were present. However, the effect was limited to the first part of the experiment, only partially confirming our initial hypothesis. The results suggest that the presence of social context in deception tasks might have a significant influence on cognitive processes associated with deception.","2015-12-15","2018-12-21 17:53:15","2018-12-21 17:53:15","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive load; deception; lying; schema; social cognition; stereotype","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence from somatoperception studies point to a generic disturbances of somatosensory components of body representations. Here we have investigated whether AN patients (N=18) and controls differed in the perception of tactile stimuli differently oriented along the body axes. We tested the hypothesis that patients perceive and represent their body selectively larger in only one dimension. To this aim we used elementary tactile measures for tactile acuity (Von Frey's test and two-point discrimination thresholds - 2 PD) and tactile discrimination measures. The rationale is based on the assumption that AN patients have a wider body representation, and that tactile body representation tasks (Tactile Distance task) oriented across the bodies (horizontally) are influenced by distorted body representations compared with tactile stimuli oriented along the bodies (vertically) which should not be influenced by body representations. Results showed that patients judged horizontal tactile stimuli significantly wider than the same stimuli oriented vertically.These results suggest that human brain perceives things differently based on body representations and that the beliefs concerning body size influence the specific somatosensory process of tactile experience.

Therefore a repeat household survey of CMD and its associated risk factors was conducted in Maseno area, Kisumu county in Kenya, using a demographic surveillance site as the sample frame, in order to test the hypotheses that (a) the prevalence of CMD would increase between 2004 and 2013 due to the intervening political, social and economic pressures; (b) as in 2004, there would be no gender difference in prevalence of CMD. Methods: One thousand one hundred ninety households were selected, and 1158 adult participants consented to be interviewed with a structured epidemiological assessment while 32 refused to participate in the study interviews, giving a response rate of 97.3 %. Results: The study found that the overall prevalence of CMD in 2013 was 10.3 %. However, there were significantly higher rates of having any CMD in 2013 if one was female (OR 6.2, p < 0.001), divorced/widowed (OR 2.5, p < 0.003), aged over 60 (OR 2.3, p = 0.052), either self-employed (OR 3.3 p < 0.001) or employed (OR 3.3, p < 0.001), or belonged to the lowest asset quintile (OR 2.5, p = .0.004) after adjusting for other variables significant at the bivariate level. The overall prevalence in 2013 was consistent with that found in 2004, despite intervening political and community turbulence. However, this apparent consistency masks the development of a striking difference in prevalence between the genders. Over the decade 2004-13, the prevalence for men dropped from 10.9 to 3.8 % (P = 0.001) and the prevalence for women increased from 10.8 to 17.5 % (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Common mental disorders continue to pose a significant public health burden in Kenya, and gender related vulnerability merits further research and is relevant for health worker training.","2015-12-09","2018-12-21 17:53:17","2018-12-21 17:53:17","","","","","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Assets; Common mental disorder; Employment; Gender; Life events; Prevalence; Surveillance site; Ten year trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on the entrepreneurship context has identified precipitating events as a promising factor to overcome such limitations. Precipitating events are able to capture the effect of external factors that can potentially impede or facilitate the performance of behaviour and influence IT innovation adoption by entrepreneurs. The data used to test the hypothesis are collected from various spectrums of Malaysian industries. A total of 1000 businesses were identified and the authors personally distributed questionnaires with 351 completed questionnaires returned. The research model was applied using the structural equation modelling technique. The results show that intention to use has a significant positive influence on the use of IT innovation. The results show that precipitating events moderate the relationship between intentions and use behaviour. A low or moderate level of precipitating events (positive or negative) will increase entrepreneurs' use of IT innovation, while a high level of precipitating events will decrease entrepreneurs' use of IT innovation.","2015-12-02","2018-12-21 17:53:18","2018-12-21 17:53:18","","1171-1185","","12, SI","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","intention-behaviour gap; IT adoption; technology acceptance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was aimed at exploring how transracial adoptees cope with the construction of their ethnic identity. Administering a self-report questionnaire to 127 transracial adoptees and their mothers, for a total of 254 participants, we first investigated the association between mothers' cultural socialisation (enculturation and preparation for bias strategies) and adoptees' ethnic identity (i.e. ethnic identity exploration and ethnic identity affirmation dimensions). We then investigated whether ethnic identity affects self-esteem by testing the hypothesis that national identity moderates the relationship between ethnic identity and self-esteem. Results revealed that mothers' enculturation (but not their preparation for bias) supported adoptees' ethnic identity exploration, which in turn was positively associated with ethnic identity affirmation. Moreover, we confirmed the moderation effect: ethnic identity affirmation.","2015-12","2018-12-21 17:53:19","2018-12-21 17:53:19","","413-421","","6","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cultural socialisation; Ethnic identity; National identity; Self-esteem; Transracial adoption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the recategorization effect of high versus low respect from outgroup members was replicated, no such effect was observed for respect from ingroup members.

This error, labeled the illusory transparency of intention Keysar (Cognitive Psychology 26:165-208, 1994) shows how readers assume that privileged information is also known by story characters; this error is assumed to indicate a general difficulty individuals have in taking the perspective of others. The study investigates whether bilingual readers also demonstrate the illusory transparency effect when reading in their two languages, and tests the hypothesis that the languages activate different cultural mindsets that may or may not enhance the error. In two studies, 175 Filipino-English bilinguals were presented narrative passages in English and Filipino containing positive or negative privileged information that was either spoken or written by one of the characters. Participants assessed how a character would respond to an ambiguous remark by another character. In both studies, privileged information influenced readers' ratings in both languages, demonstrating the illusory transparency effect in bilinguals. Study 1 did not show a moderating effect of language, but Study 2 (which had higher observed statistical power) revealed a significant moderating effect of language, where the illusory transparency effect was stronger in English texts. The results support the hypothesis that the English language primed the individualist mindset that was not supportive of cognitive processes that consider perspectives of others. The results are discussed in terms of how language plays an indirect role in shaping thought processes involved in perspective taking.","2015-12","2018-12-21 17:53:20","2018-12-21 17:53:20","","744-752","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bilinguals; Cultural mindset; Illusory transparency; Linguistic priming; Perspective-taking; Reading; Sarcasm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, renewed interest in the phenomenology of AH raised questions related to their neural substrates. Hence, the neural basis of AH self/other attribution have yet to be investigated as beliefs regarding the origin of the voices is a cardinal feature of AH phenomenology. As the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) play a key role in disentangling the origin of sensory events and in self/other distinction, we tested the hypothesis that the morphology of the IPL/TPJ area may be involved in AH self/other attribution. Magnetic resonance images of 39 right-handed patients with persistent auditory hallucinations and 19 healthy subjects were analyzed with sulcus-based morphometry. AH self-other attribution were found to be associated with the sulcal pattern of the posterior part of the Sylvian fissure, encompassing the IPL/TPJ area. The preference for the attribution of AH to self or to others could be associated with early neurodevelopmental events as the sulcal pattern is determined during fetal life and is stable after birth. Our study also raises basic cognitive questions regarding self-consciousness and suggest that impairments at a pre-reflexive level, leading to hearing his/her thoughts as voices ('I' level or feeling of agency), and a reflexive level leading to attribution belief ('Me' level or judgment of agency) are likely involved in AH.

The moderating role of team interdependence in the relationship between the dual sides of transformational leadership and team knowledge sharing is also discussed. This paper draws from social identity and contingency perspectives to uncover the mediating role of team knowledge sharing as well as the moderating role of team interdependence. Multi-source data were collected from 242 members and their leaders within 60 R&D teams for use in testing the hypotheses. The results indicate that group-focused TFL is positively related to team innovation via team knowledge sharing, whereas differentiated individual-focused TFL is negatively related to team innovation via team knowledge sharing. Furthermore, team interdependence plays a moderating role in these relationships: when team interdependence is higher, the positive relationship between group-focused TFL and team knowledge sharing is stronger while the negative relationship between differentiated individual-focused TFL and team knowledge sharing is weaker. This paper shows that team knowledge sharing mediates the relationship between both group-focused TFL, differentiated individual-focused TFL, and team innovation. The relationship between group-focused TFL, differentiated individual-focused TFL, and team knowledge sharing varies as a function of team interdependence. The research findings offer practical insights for team leaders to facilitate team knowledge sharing, which in turn fosters team innovation.

In 4 experiments, participants reported their aesthetic preferences regarding a variety of targets (pictures, movements, objects, and letters). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 manipulated power and motor fluency (via motoric resonance, extraocular muscle training, and dominant hand restriction). Experiment 4 manipulated power and assessed chronic interindividual differences in motor fluency. Across these experiments, power consistently increased reliance on motor fluency in aesthetic preference judgments. This finding was not mediated by differences in mood, judgment certainty, perceived task-demands or task-enjoyment, and derived from the use of motor simulations rather than from power differences in the acquisition of motor experiences. This is the first demonstration suggesting that power changes the formation of preference judgments as a function of motor fluency experiences. The implications of this research for the links between power and action, as well as the understanding of fluency processes are discussed.","2015-12","2018-12-21 17:53:24","2018-12-21 17:53:24","","1124-1136","","6","144","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","fluency; motor and muscular ease; power; preferences; subjective experiences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objectives of the present experiments were to develop a similar experimental paradigm for investigating checking behavior, and to use it to test the hypothesis that a faulty stopping mechanism also underlies OCD checking. Methods: Participants sorted pills under the guise of beta testing a new medication system and then were given suggestions of the possibility of having made mistakes with potentially serious consequences. Later, participants engaged in a 90-s checking period and an unlimited period of checking. At baseline and three other times during the experiment, security motivation was measured with respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and subjective ratings of confidence. Experiment 1 established the parameters of the paradigm in non-patient participants, and Experiment 2 contrasted OCD checkers with OCD washers and non-patients. Results: Results for both subjective and physiological measures of security motivation closely replicated previous findings for washing behavior. Groups did not differ significantly in initial activation, but the OCD checkers were unable to reduce their activation by engaging in period of checking that was ample for returning controls to baseline. Limitations: The sample size for the patient groups was modest. Conclusions: These results lend further support to the security-motivation theory of OCD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Mediating Role of Cognitive Dysregulation","DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY","","0012-1649","10.1037/a0039795","","Children growing up in poverty have a higher likelihood of exposure to multiple forms of adversity that jeopardize their chances of academic success. The current paper identifies school mobility, or changing schools, as 1 such poverty-related risk. Using a sample of low-income, predominantly ethnic-minority children (n = 381) in Chicago, this study tests the hypothesis that repeatedly changing schools during the 5-year period between Head Start (preschool) and third grade is a potent predictor of children's math achievement in fourth grade and that children's cognitive dysregulation serves as a mechanism through which school mobility may negatively affect children's math achievement. Hierarchical linear models controlling for baseline child and family characteristics (including children's early math and dysregulation measured during Head Start) revealed an inverse relation between the number of times low-income children changed schools between preschool and third grade and children's math achievement on state standardized tests in fourth grade. Furthermore, frequently changing schools (3 or 4 school changes over the same time period) was positively associated with teacher-reported cognitive dysregulation in third grade and negatively associated with children's math achievement in fourth grade. Evidence for the role of children's cognitive dysregulation as a partial statistical mediator was found for the relation between frequently changing schools and math achievement, even after accounting for baseline risk. Results are discussed in terms of school policies, practices, and intervention strategies to prevent the disruptive and potentially stressful experiences of school mobility for young, low-income children.","2015-12","2018-12-21 17:53:26","2018-12-21 17:53:26","","1725-1739","","12","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","low-income children; math achievement; poverty-related risk; school mobility; self-regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: Ninety-six adolescents (47 males, mean age = 13 years -10 months) completed standardized scales assessing Bulimic symptoms, trust beliefs in others and loneliness at Time 1/T1 and again 5 months later at Time 2/T2. Results: Analyses showed that: (1) Bulimic symptoms were negatively correlated with trust beliefs, (2) Bulimic symptoms were positively correlated with loneliness, and (3) trust beliefs were negatively correlated with loneliness. The SEM and mediation analyses showed that trust beliefs at T1 were negatively and concurrently associated with Bulimic symptoms at T1 and longitudinally (and negatively) predicted changes in Bulimic symptoms. It was found that loneliness at T1 statistically mediated those concurrent and longitudinal relations.

To test the hypothesis that cognitive impairment in older adults is associated with all-cause mortality risk and the risk increases when the degree of cognitive impairment augments; and then, if this association is confirmed, to report the population-attributable fraction (PAF) of mortality due to cognitive impairment. Method. A representative random community sample of individuals aged over 55 was interviewed, and 4557 subjects remaining alive at the end of the first year of follow-up were included in the analysis. Instruments used in the assessment included the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), the History and Aetiology Schedule (HAS) and the Geriatric Mental State (GMS)-AGECAT. For the standardised degree of cognitive impairment Perneczky et al's MMSE criteria were applied. Mortality information was obtained from the official population registry. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the association between MMSE degrees of cognitive impairment and mortality risk. We also estimated the PAF of mortality due to specific MMSE stages. Results. Cognitive impairment was associated with mortality risk, the risk increasing in parallel with the degree of cognitive impairment (Hazard ratio, HR: 1.18 in the `mild' degree of impairment; HR: 1.29 in the `moderate' degree; and HR: 2.08 in the `severe' degree). The PAF of mortality due to severe cognitive impairment was 3.49%. Conclusions. A gradient of increased mortality-risk associated with severity of cognitive impairment was observed. The results support the claim that routine assessment of cognitive function in older adults should be considered in clinical practice.","2015-12","2018-12-21 17:53:28","2018-12-21 17:53:28","","503-511","","6","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive impairment; Mini Mental Status Examination; mortality; population-attributable fraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, clinical outcomes in TF-CBT are highly variable, indicating a need to identify reliable predictors that allow forecasting treatment response. Here, we test the hypothesis that functional neuroimaging correlates of emotion processing predict PTSD symptom reduction during Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among adolescent girls with PTSD. Thirty-four adolescent girls with PTSD related to physical or sexual assault were enrolled in TF-CBT, delivered in an approximately 12 session format, in an open trial. Prior to treatment, they were engaged in an implicit threat processing task during 3T fMRI, during which they viewed faces depicting fearful or neutral expressions. Among adolescent girls completing TF-CBT (n = 23), slopes of PTSD symptom trajectories during TF-CBT were significantly related to pre-treatment degree of bilateral amygdala activation while viewing fearful vs neutral images. Adolescents with less symptom reduction were characterized by greater amygdala activation to both threat and neutral images (i.e., less threat-safety discrimination), whereas adolescents with greater symptom reduction were characterized by amygdala activation only to threat images. These clinical outcome relationships with pre-treatment bilateral amygdala activation remained when controlling for possible confounding demographic or clinical variables (e.g., concurrent psychotropic medication, comorbid diagnoses). While limited by a lack of a control group, these preliminary results suggest that pre-treatment amygdala reactivity to fear stimuli, a component of neurocircuitry models of PTSD, positively predicts symptom reduction during TF-CBT among assaulted adolescent girls, providing support for an objective measure for forecasting treatment response in this vulnerable population.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that lower-level processes such as lexical support for phonetic perception are a contributing factor to these differences. For native listeners, it has been shown that the perception of ambiguous acoustic-phonetic segments is driven by lexical factors (Samuel Psychological Science, 12, 348-351, 2001). Here, we tested whether nonnative listeners can use lexical context in the same way. Native Hebrew speakers living in Israel were tested with American English stimuli. When subtle acoustic cues in the stimuli worked against the lexical context, these nonnative speakers showed no evidence of lexical guidance of phonetic perception. This result conflicts with the performance of native speakers, who demonstrate lexical effects on phonetic perception even with conflicting acoustic cues. When stimuli without any conflicting cues were used, the native Hebrew subjects produced results similar to those of native English speakers, showing lexical support for phonetic perception in their second language. In contrast, native Arabic speakers, who were less proficient in English than the native Hebrew speakers, showed no ability to use lexical activation to support phonetic perception, even without any conflicting cues. These results reinforce previous demonstrations of lexical support of phonetic perception and demonstrate how proficiency modulates the use of lexical information in driving phonetic perception.","2015-12","2018-12-21 17:53:29","2018-12-21 17:53:29","","1746-1752","","6","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Nonnative listening; Spoken word recognition; Top-down lexical support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These problems might be underpinned by negatively biased processing of social stimuli. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a novel Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) training to target information processing biases in patients with AN. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with AN completed a baseline and end of intervention assessment of mood and social appraisals. The CBM training consisted of 5 sessions and included an attentional probe task to train attention towards positive social stimuli and an ambiguous scenarios task to train benign or neutral interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios. Results: AL baseline patients displayed an attention and interpretation bias towards negative social stimuli. AL the end of intervention there was a medium sized increase in attention to positive faces and fewer negative interpretations of ambiguous social stimuli. There were also lower levels of anxiety and higher levels of self-compassion in response to a judgemental video clip. Limitations: The lack of a control group is the main limitation to this preliminary study as the changes obtained may have resulted born non-specific aspects of the inpatient treatment.

Six EF measures were assessed in a sample of 5-year-old children (N = 175). The math achievement of the same children was then tested in Grades 1 and 3 using both a composite math score and three single indices of written calculation, arithmetical facts, and problem solving. Using previous results obtained from the same sample of children, a confirmatory factor analysis examining the latent EF structure in kindergarten indicated that a two-factor model provided the best fit for the data. In this model, inhibition and working memory (WM)-flexibility were separate dimensions. A full structural equation model was then used to test the hypothesis that math achievement (the composite math score and single math scores) in Grades 1 and 3 could be explained by the two EF components comprising the kindergarten model. The results indicate that the WM-flexibility component measured during the preschool period substantially predicts mathematical achievement, especially in Grade 3. The math composite scores were predicted by the WM-flexibility factor at both grade levels. In Grade 3, both problem solving and arithmetical facts were predicted by the WM-flexibility component. The results empirically support interventions that target EF as an important component of early childhood mathematics education. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find that conflict is associated with reductions in all types of cooperation, with reduced donations to a neutral charity, and both in-group and out-group primary schools.

Recent evidence suggests that, for race, the recognition bias is also accompanied by different visual scanning strategies for own- compared to other-race faces. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these differences in visual scanning patterns extend also to the comparison between own and other-age faces and contribute to the ownage recognition advantage. Participants (young adults with limited experience with infants) were tested in an old/new recognition memory task where they encoded and subsequently recognized a series of adult and infant faces while their eye movements were recorded. Consistent with findings on the other-race bias, we found evidence of an own-age bias in recognition which was accompanied by differential scanning patterns, and consequently differential encoding strategies, for own-compared to other-age faces. Gaze patterns for own age faces involved a more dynamic sampling of the internal features and longer viewing time on the eye region compared to the other regions of the face. This latter strategy was extensively employed during learning (vs. recognition) and was positively correlated to discriminability. These results suggest that deeply encoding the eye region is functional for recognition and that the own age bias is evident not only in differential recognition performance, but also in the employment of different sampling strategies found to be effective for accurate recognition.","2015-11-03","2018-12-21 17:53:35","2018-12-21 17:53:35","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adult faces; age bias; encoding; eye movements; face age; infant faces; recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study investigated the influence of parallel activation of the components of complex noun phrases on the generation of subject-verb agreement. Specifically, the lexical interference account (Gillespie & Pearlmutter, 2011b; Solomon & Pearlmutter, 2004) predicts more agreement errors (i.e., attraction) for subject phrases in which the head and local noun mismatch in number (e.g., the apple next to the pears) when nouns are planned in parallel than when they are planned in sequence. We used a speeded picture description task that yielded sentences such as the apple next to the pears is red. The objects mentioned in the noun phrase were either semantically related or unrelated. To induce agreement errors, pictures sometimes mismatched in number. In order to manipulate the likelihood of parallel processing of the objects and to test the hypothesized relationship between parallel processing and the rate of agreement errors, the pictures were either placed close together or far apart. Analyses of the participants' eye movements and speech onset latencies indicated slower processing of the first object and stronger interference from the related (compared to the unrelated) second object in the close than in the far condition. Analyses of the agreement errors yielded an attraction effect, with more errors in mismatching than in matching conditions. However, the magnitude of the attraction effect did not differ across the close and far conditions. Thus, spatial proximity encouraged parallel processing of the pictures, whichled to interference of the associated conceptual and/or lexical representation, but, contrary to the prediction, it did not lead to more attraction errors.

The exact nature of this relationship remains unclear, however. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that increasing attention to salient, but nonemotional, distracting stimuli would lead to increases in state anxiety by manipulating attentional strategies during a visual search task. We randomly assigned students low and high in trait anxiety to either a 1-session singleton detection training group or a feature search group. Singleton detection training increases distraction by salient, nonemotional stimuli whereas feature search training protects attention against distracting stimuli. Findings revealed that singleton detection training not only increased distraction by salient, nonemotional stimuli but also increased state anxiety. Moreover, this increase in state anxiety was most pronounced among high trait-anxious individuals. In contrast, feature search training protected attention against distracting stimuli and against increases in state anxiety, particularly in the high trait-anxious individuals. Together, the current findings provide initial support for the notion that distraction by salient, nonemotional stimuli can increase state anxiety levels. Furthermore, these results suggest that individuals already vulnerable to experience anxiety are most likely to be affected by distraction by salient, nonemotional stimuli, and that training anxious individuals to focus on specific shape features may be a viable attention modification intervention.","2015-11","2018-12-21 17:53:39","2018-12-21 17:53:39","","834-843","","6","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anxiety; attention; attention training; attentional capture; search strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The etiology and severity of dyspnea on admission and all-cause mortality during follow-up (median, 2.3 years) were recorded. Results: Anxiety and depression were more prevalent in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=53; 42% and 31%) and heart failure (HF) (n=80; 33% and 23%) than in other causes of acute dyspnea (15% and 11%).

This finding provided the first neural signature of biases toward overgeneralized self-blaming emotions (eg, “feeling guilty for everything”), known to have a key role in cognitive vulnerability to MDD. It is unknown whether this neural signature predicts risk of recurrence, a crucial step in establishing its potential as a prognostic biomarker, which is urgently needed for stratification into pathophysiologically more homogeneous subgroups and for novel treatments. OBJECTIVE To use fMRI in remitted MDD at baseline to test the hypothesis that RSATL-SCSR connectivity for self-blaming relative to other-blaming emotions predicts subsequent recurrence of depressive episodes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study from June 16, 2011, to October 10, 2014, in a clinical research facility completed by 75 psychotropic medication-free patients with remitted MDD and no relevant comorbidity. In total, 31 remained in stable remission, and 25 developed a recurring episode over the 14 months of clinical follow-up and were included in the primary analysis. Thirty-nine control participants with no personal or family history of MDD were recruited for further comparison. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Between-group difference (recurring vs stable MDD) in RSATL connectivity, with an a priori SCSR region of interest for self-blaming vs other-blaming emotions. RESULTS We corroborated our hypothesis that during the experience of self-blaming vs other-blaming emotions, RSATL-SCSR connectivity predicted risk of subsequent recurrence. The recurring MDD group showed higher connectivity than the stable MDD group (familywise error-corrected P < .05 over the a priori SCSR region of interest) and the control group. In addition, the recurring MDD group also exhibited RSATL hyperconnectivity with the right ventral putamen and claustrum and the temporoparietal junction. Together, these regions predicted recurrence with 75% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a robust demonstration of an fMRI signature of recurrence risk in remitted MDD. Additional studies are needed for its further optimization and validation as a prognostic biomarker.","2015-11","2018-12-21 17:53:42","2018-12-21 17:53:42","","1119-1126","","11","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is most commonly assumed that some forms of abuse (eg, physical and sexual abuse) are more harmful than others (eg, emotional abuse and neglect); other assumptions are that each form of abuse has specific consequences and that the effects of abuse differ across sex and race. OBJECTIVE To determine whether widely held assumptions about child abuse and neglect are valid by testing the hypothesis that different types of child maltreatment (CM) actually have equivalent, broad, and universal effects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study assessed 2292 racially and ethnically diverse boys (1254 [54.7%]) and girls (1038 [45.3%]) aged 5 to 13 years (mean [SD] age, 9.0 [2.0] years) who attended a research summer camp program for low-income, school-aged children from July 1, 1986, to August 15, 2012. Of these children, 1193 (52.1%) had a well-documented history of maltreatment. Analysis was conducted from September 25, 2013, to June 1, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Various forms of internalizing and externalizing personality and psychopathologic traits were assessed using multiple informant ratings on the California Child Q-Set and Teacher Report Form as well as child self-reported depression and peer ratings of aggression and disruptive behavior. RESULTS Structural analysis showed that different forms of CM have equivalent psychiatric and behavioral effects, ranging from anxiety and depression to rule-breaking and aggression. We also found that nonsexual CM alters 2 broad vulnerability factors, internalizing (beta = 0.185; SE = 0.028; P <.001) and externalizing (beta = 0.283; SE = 0.023; P <.001), that underlie multiple forms of psychiatric and behavioral disturbance. We show that CM has comparable consequences for boys and girls of different races, and our results allowed us to describe a base rate and co-occurrence issue that makes it difficult to identify the unique effects of child sexual abuse. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our findings challenge widely held beliefs about how child abuse should be recognized and treated-a responsibility that often lies with the physician. Because different types of child abuse have equivalent, broad, and universal effects, effective treatments for maltreatment of any sort are likely to have comprehensive psychological benefits. Population-level prevention and intervention strategies should emphasize emotional abuse, which occurs with high frequency but is less punishable than other types of child maltreatment.","2015-11","2018-12-21 17:53:42","2018-12-21 17:53:42","","1135-1142","","11","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using hierarchical linear modeling and survey data collected from 1,238 employees in 33 organizations, employee-level supervisor safety enforcement behaviors (and to a less consistent extent, organizational-level safety climate) predicted employee accident underreporting. There was also a significant cross-level interaction, such that the effect of supervisor enforcement on underreporting was attenuated in organizations with a positive safety climate. These results may benefit human resources and safety professionals by pinpointing methods of increasing the accuracy of accident reporting, reducing actual safety incidents, and reducing the costs to individuals and organizations that result from underreporting.","2015-11","2018-12-21 17:53:43","2018-12-21 17:53:43","","1899-1907","","6","100","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","accident underreporting; safety climate; supervisor safety leadership; transactional leadership","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smartphones offer unique opportunities for continuous monitoring and automatic collection of real-time data. The objectives of the paper were to test the hypotheses that (i) daily electronic self-monitored data and (ii) automatically generated objective data collected using smartphones correlate with clinical ratings of depressive and manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder. MethodsSoftware for smartphones (the MONARCA I system) that collects automatically generated objective data and self-monitored data on illness activity in patients with bipolar disorder was developed by the authors. A total of 61 patients aged 18-60 years and with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder according to ICD-10 used the MONARCA I system for six months. Depressive and manic symptoms were assessed monthly using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HDRS-17) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), respectively. Data are representative of over 400 clinical ratings. Analyses were computed using linear mixed-effect regression models allowing for both between individual variation and within individual variation over time. ResultsAnalyses showed significant positive correlations between the duration of incoming and outgoing calls/day and scores on the HDRS-17, and significant positive correlations between the number and duration of incoming calls/day and scores on the YMRS; the number of and duration of outgoing calls/day and scores on the YMRS; and the number of outgoing text messages/day and scores on the YMRS. Analyses showed significant negative correlations between self-monitored data (i.e., mood and activity) and scores on the HDRS-17, and significant positive correlations between self-monitored data (i.e., mood and activity) and scores on the YMRS. Finally, the automatically generated objective data were able to discriminate between affective states. ConclusionsAutomatically generated objective data and self-monitored data collected using smartphones correlate with clinically rated depressive and manic symptoms and differ between affective states in patients with bipolar disorder.

Emerging evidence suggests that trauma-related stress symptoms (TSS) predict significant health complications following SCT. The aim of the current prospective study was to examine TSS in the acute aftermath of SCT as a predictor of neutrophil recovery following SCT, a crucial component of immune defense against infection. MethodsFifty-one autologous SCT recipients were assessed for TSS 7days after SCT. Patients' absolute neutrophil counts were collected from medical charts for the first 30days following SCT. Hierarchical linear growth modeling was used to test the hypothesis that TSS at day 7 would be associated with delayed recovery of neutrophil counts from days 9 to 30 post SCT, that is, when neutrophil counts began to recover. ResultsAs hypothesized, TSS measured 7days after SCT was significantly associated with slower neutrophil recovery even after pre-existing TSS, depression, distress related to physical symptoms, and potential medical confounds were statistically controlled. Exploratory analyses showed that of the TSS symptom clusters, re-experiencing symptoms and hyperarousal symptoms predicted neutrophil recovery, whereas avoidance symptoms did not. ConclusionThough traumatic stress symptoms may be a normative response to SCT, our findings suggest that TSS following SCT may interfere with neutrophil recovery and overall health. These results provide further insight as to potential mechanisms by which traumatic stress translates to poor medical outcomes for SCT patients.

For four minorities, results indicated that stereotyping them as (a) low in morality but high in competence or (b) high in morality but low in competence predicted greater system justification. These results suggest that even in a context that is low in support for the status quo, complementary stereotyping of ethnic minorities is linked to system justification processes.

This study aims to link features of mathematical difficulties to certain potential etiologies. First, we wanted to test the hypothesis of a serial-order learning deficit in adults with dyscalculia. For this purpose we used a Hebb repetition learning task. Second, we wanted to explore a recent hypothesis according to which hypersensitivity-to-interference hampers the storage of arithmetic facts and leads to a particular profile of dyscalculia. We therefore used interfering and non-interfering repeated sequences in the Hebb paradigm. A final test was used to assess the memory trace of the non-interfering sequence and the capacity to manipulate it. In line with our predictions, we observed that people with dyscalculia who show good conceptual knowledge in mathematics but impaired arithmetic fluency suffer from increased sensitivity-to-interference compared to controls. Secondly, people with dyscalculia who show a deficit in a global mathematical test suffer from a serial-order learning deficit characterized by a slow learning and a quick degradation of the memory trace of the repeated sequence. A serial-order learning impairment could be one of the explanations for a basic numerical deficit, since it is necessary for the number-word sequence acquisition. Among the different profiles of dyscalculia, this study provides new evidence and refinement for two particular profiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This is the first paper to examine this question using DSM-IV diagnosis of depression and data from a two-wave cohort of adolescents. Methods: Participants were 4175 youths 11-17 years of age sampled from the community who were followed up a year later (n=3134). Major depression was assessed using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Body image was measured with perceived weight. Obesity was defined as BMI >= 95th percentile using measured height and weight. Results: When we examined a model which included obesity, perceived weight, major depression and covariates, there was no association between major depression at baseline and obesity at follow-up. We found no independent association between major depression and body weight. Limitations: The study was limited in that it is not a national sample, BMI was the only measure of adiposity, perceived weight was the only measure of body image, and there were no data on lifetime trajectories of depression, obesity, or body image. Conclusions: If there is an etiologic link between major depression and body weight among adolescents, it most likely operates through processes involving components of body image, since controlling for body image eliminated the association between depression and obesity. Clinically, addressing body image in depressed patients who are obese may improve outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In relative numerosity judgments, accuracy depends on the ratio of the two numerosities (Weber's Law) for numerosities >4 (the typical ANS range), while for numerosities <= 4 (OTS range) there is usually no ratio effect. However, recent studies have found evidence for ratio effects for small numerosities, challenging the idea that the OTS might be involved for small number discrimination. Here we tested the hypothesis that the lack of ratio effect in the numbers 1-4 is largely dependent on the type of stimulus presentation. We investigated relative numerosity judgments in college students using three different procedures: a simultaneous presentation of intermingled and separate groups of dots in separate experiments, and a further experiment with sequential presentation. As predicted, in the large number range, ratio dependence was observed in all tasks. By contrast, in the small number range, ratio insensitivity was found in one task (sequential presentation). In a fourth experiment, we showed that the presence of intermingled distractors elicited a ratio effect, while easily distinguishable distractors did not. As the different ratio sensitivity for small and large numbers has been often interpreted in terms of the activation of the OTS and ANS, our results suggest that numbers 1-4 may be represented by both numerical systems and that the experimental context, such as the presence/absence of task-irrelevant items in the visual field, would determine which system is activated.","2015-10-29","2018-12-21 17:53:48","2018-12-21 17:53:48","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ANS; non-verbal cognitive systems; numerical cognition; OTS; subitizing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is thought to be metabolically beneficial to align ongoing oscillatory activity to the relevant inputs in a predictable stream, so that they will enter at optimal processing phases of the spontaneously occurring rhythmic excitability fluctuations. However, some contexts have a more predictable temporal structure than others. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the processing of rhythmic sounds is more efficient than the processing of irregularly timed sounds. To do this, we simultaneously measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electro-encephalograms (EEG) while participants detected oddball target sounds in alternating blocks of rhythmic (e.g., with equal inter-stimulus intervals) or random (e.g., with randomly varied inter-stimulus intervals) tone sequences. Behaviorally, participants detected target sounds faster and more accurately when embedded in rhythmic streams. The fMRI response in the auditory cortex was stronger during random compared to random tone sequence processing. Simultaneously recorded N1 responses showed larger peak amplitudes and longer latencies for tones in the random (vs. the rhythmic) streams. These results reveal complementary evidence for more efficient neural and perceptual processing during temporally predictable sensory contexts.","2015-10-27","2018-12-21 17:53:49","2018-12-21 17:53:49","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","auditory cortex; EEG; fMRI; rhythm; sound processing; temporal context","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Respondents may also be more likely to agree with harsh sanctions when they have fewer offender- and case-specific details to consider. Here, we test the hypothesis that attitudes supporting statutory exclusion laws measured in the absence of specific case-specific details may not be the best indicator of agreement with such laws in practice. We found that support for statutory exclusion was affected by exposure to information about an offender's unique situation and by exposure to general scientific information about adolescent development. These results suggest that despite apparent widespread agreement with automatic exclusion statutes, laypersons consider factors other than those allowed by the law when they are asked how to treat an individual offender.","2015-10-20","2018-12-21 17:53:51","2018-12-21 17:53:51","","423-448","","5","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attitudes toward juvenile offenders; automatic waiver; juvenile justice; juvenile offenders; public opinion; statutory exclusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In line with recent research, we suggest that a full understanding of the role of self-esteem in depression requires consideration of contingent self-esteem as well. For most people, competence is an important source of self-esteem. Students in particular link their self-esteem to academic competence. To test the hypothesis that academic contingent self-esteem (aCSE) predicts depressive symptoms (DS), two studies were conducted. Preceding the investigation of our hypothesis, the first purpose of Study 1 was to describe the development of aCSE, self-esteem (SE) level, and DS in adolescence in a sample of German students aged 10-16 (N = 1888) in order to provide a foundation for further analyses. Then, to address the main question, age and gender differences in aCSE, SE level, and DS as well as their relations were investigated. The results show that (1) gender differences emerged after the age of 10/11. Girls scored higher on aCSE and DS and lower on SE level than did boys, and aCSE and DS decreased and SE level increased over time in boys, while the rather disadvantageous pattern in girls remained stable. (2) After controlling for SE level and aCSE, the effects of gender and age x gender interaction on DS disappeared, suggesting an influence of aCSE on DS. (3) aCSE predicted DS over and above SE level. Since the results of Study 1 did not allow for causal conclusions, a longitudinal study (N = 160) was conducted to further investigate the causal role of aCSE. According to the diathesis stress model, aCSE was expected to serve as a diathesis for developing DS in the face of academic stress (daily hassles) during an academic semester at university. The results of Study 2 revealed that aCSE interacted with corresponding hassles to predict increases in DS. High levels of academic stress led to increases in DS only among students who strongly based their SE on academic competence. Implications for prevention and intervention of depression are discussed.","2015-10-20","2018-12-21 17:53:52","2018-12-21 17:53:52","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","academic contingency of self-worth; adolescence; contingencies of self-worth; contingent self-esteem; depression; gender differences; self-esteem; self-esteem level","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This provides the opportunity to study the dopaminergic influences on the perception and awareness of action. Here we examined the perception of the outcome of a goal-directed action made by medicated patients with PD. A visuomotor task probed the integration of sensorimotor signals with the positive expectations of outcomes (Self priors), which in healthy adults bias perception toward success in proportion to trait optimism. We tested the hypotheses that (i) the priors on the perception of the consequences of one's own actions differ between patients and age- and sex-matched controls, and (ii) that these priors are modulated by the levodopa dose equivalent (LDEs) in patients. There was no overall difference between patients and controls in the perceptual priors used. However, the precision of patient priors was inversely related to their LDE. Patients with high LDE showed more accurate priors, representing predictions that were closer to the true distribution of performance. Such accuracy has previously been demonstrated when observing the actions of others, suggesting abnormal awareness of action in these patients. These results confirm a link between dopamine and the positive expectation of the outcome of one's own actions, and may have implications for the management of PD.","2015-10-08","2018-12-21 17:53:53","2018-12-21 17:53:53","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agency; Bayesian; dopamine; inverted U-shaped function; Parkinson's disease; placebo; positive expectation; voluntary action","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Speakers do not enunciate each word separately, even to infants; rather, whattheysayrunstogether. To relate an object (say, an apple) to its referent, infants must notice the interactant's target of attention (the apple) and at the same time single out the word that refers to it as the other person speaks (Lookattheapple!). We contend that caregivers through their actions assist by directing and educating an infant's attention, particularly through the use of a show gesture. The onset/offset, rhythm, tempo, and duration of these show gestures are synchronous with the saying of the words referring to the target objects. Our prior research using eye tracking found that show gestures lead an infant to look at the object presented as the word for it is uttered and that show gestures facilitate word learning. In this research we tested the hypothesis that show gestures also lead to enhanced attentional processing as measured through pupil dilation. Comparing pupil diameters while words were introduced with a show, static, or asynchronous dynamic gesture, we found that pupil dilation occurred for the show gesture condition and was positively correlated with word learning.","2015-10-02","2018-12-21 17:53:53","2018-12-21 17:53:53","","290-299","","4","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Executive processes consist of at least two sets of functions: one concerned with cognitive control and the other with reward-related decision making. Abnormal performance in both sets occurs in late-life depression. This study tested the hypothesis that only abnormal performance in cognitive control tasks predicts poor outcomes of late-life depression treated with escitalopram. Method. We studied older subjects with major depression (N = 53) and non-depressed subjects (N = 30). Executive functions were tested with the Iowa Gambling Test (IGT), Stroop Color-Word Test, Tower of London (ToL), and Dementia Rating Scale - Initiation/Perseveration domain (DRS-IP). After a 2-week placebo washout, depressed subjects received escitalopram (target daily dose: 20 mg) for 12 weeks. Results. There were no significant differences between depressed and non-depressed subjects on executive function tests. Hierarchical cluster analysis of depressed subjects identified a Cognitive Control cluster (abnormal Stroop, ToL, DRS-IP), a Reward-Related cluster (IGT), and an Executively Unimpaired cluster. Decline in depression was greater in the Executively Unimpaired (t = -2.09, df = 331, p = 0.0375) and the Reward-Related (t = -2.33, df = 331, p = 0.0202) clusters than the Cognitive Control cluster. The Executively Unimpaired cluster (t = 2.17, df = 331, p = 0.03) and the Reward-Related cluster (t = 2.03, df = 331, p = 0.0433) had a higher probability of remission than the Cognitive Control cluster. Conclusions. Dysfunction of cognitive control functions, but not reward-related decision making, may influence the decline of symptoms and the probability of remission of late-life depression treated with escitalopram. If replicated, simple to administer cognitive control tests may be used to select depressed older patients at risk for poor outcomes to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors who may require structured psychotherapy.","2015-10","2018-12-21 17:53:55","2018-12-21 17:53:55","","3111-3120","","14","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive control; Executive function; late-life depression; remission; reward processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, less clear is whether the SES has a direct effect on the development of schizophrenia. In this longitudinal study, we test the hypothesis that parental SES is associated with the prognosis of individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. One hundred and sixteen individuals who were determined as UHR using a Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) were classified into three groups based on the parental SES levels assessed by the Hollingshead-Redlich scale. There were no differences in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) at baseline. However, at the 1-year follow-up, the higher versus lower SES group showed significant differences in clinical measures including SAPS, SANS, PANSS positive and negative scales as well as BPRS scores. Most of these clinical differences were attenuated by the second year of follow-up with no sign of an increased rate of conversion to psychosis derived from a socioeconomically disadvantaged status. However, SAPS and PANSS positive scale still revealed sub-threshold positive symptoms within the low SES group at the 2-year follow-up. Moreover, especially for the subjects who continued the follow-ups for 1 year and/or 2 years, the changes of clinical symptoms between the baseline and follow-ups showed that there were significant symptom changes in higher and middle SES groups within the 1-year period already, but the lower SES group showed significant recovery at the second year. Our findings suggest that low parental SES can be detrimental to the prognosis phase of individuals at UHR. Limited supportive socioeconomic resources may slow the rate of symptom recovery in UHR subjects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This intuitively accounts for how well people can remember a cued object, relative to their memory for that same object presented without a cue. However, it is possible that this superior memory does not purely reflect storage of the cued object in working memory. We tested the hypothesis that cues presented during a stream of objects, followed by a short retention interval and immediate memory test, can change how information is handled by long-term memory. We tested this hypothesis by using a family of frontal event-related potentials believed to reflect long-term memory storage. We found that these frontal indices of long-term memory were sensitive to the task relevance of objects signaled by auditory cues, even when the objects repeated frequently, such that proactive interference was high. Our findings indicate the problematic nature of assuming process purity in the study of working memory, and demonstrate that frequent stimulus repetitions fail to isolate the role of working memory mechanisms.","2015-10","2018-12-21 17:54:00","2018-12-21 17:54:00","","1349-1357","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive neuroscience; Cognitive neuroscience of memory; Long-term memory; Working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mental disorders themselves are associated with an increased risk for HIV/AIDs and STIs as well, and thus may mediate the association between CSA and HIV/AIDS and other STIs. The links among CSA, disorders, and STIs are unclear, however. The current study tested the hypothesis that the association of CSA with STIs is mediated by adult transdiagnostic psychopathology. We examined the potential mediating role of transdiagnostic psychopathology factors internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT)-in the association between CSA and receiving a past-year diagnosis of HIV, AIDS, or another STI in a large, national probability sample of adults (N = 34,653). Using indirect effects modeling, we found that 54.4% of the association between CSA and subsequent HIV/AIDS/STI diagnosis operated through transdiagnostic psychopathology. The proposed mediation model was supported, indicating that individuals reporting CSA had higher estimated levels of latent general liabilities for INT and EXT disorders, and it was largely these liabilities that accounted for the link between CSA and heightened risk of adult HIV, AIDS, and STI diagnoses.

A novel multifamily group (MFG) intervention, informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), demonstrated efficacy in increasing medication adherence and decreasing rehospitalizations in schizophrenia patients. This report explores the hypothesis that the improved outcomes obtained through the MFG approach were mediated by changes in the patients' attitudes toward medications, subjective norms-social influences, and perceived behavioral control of resources. Method: Data from a recently completed, randomized controlled trial of MFG was used to test the hypothesis that the improvement in adherence was mediated by the 3 TPB factors. Subjects were 174 Mexican American adults with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder who had participated in a study of MFG focused on improving medication adherence. Assessments occurred at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months. Results: Path analysis revealed that the increased adherence associated with MFG was mediated by improvements in subjective norms but not attitudes toward medications nor perceived behavioral control. Conclusion: An MFG treatment specifically tailored to increase medication adherence among Mexican Americans with schizophrenia achieved its benefits by leveraging social influences through teaching family members how to support medication adherence in their ill relatives.","2015-10","2018-12-21 17:54:02","2018-12-21 17:54:02","","985-993","","5","83","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","antipsychotic medication; family psychoeducation; schizophrenia; treatment adherence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants categorised spoken words in six-item lists as they were presented, according to their semantic or phonological properties, then repeated the items in presentation order (Experiment 1). Despite matched categorisation performance between conditions, semantically-categorised words were correctly recalled more often than phonologically-categorised words. This accuracy advantage in the semantic condition was accompanied by fewer phoneme recombination errors. Comparisons with a no-categorisation ISR baseline (Experiment 2) indicated that, although categorisations were disruptive overall, recombination errors were specifically rarer following semantic categorisation. Experiment 3 replicated the key findings from Experiment 1 and also revealed fewer phonologically-related errors following semantic categorisation compared to a perceptual categorisation of high or low pitch. Therefore, augmented activation of semantic representations stabilises the phonological traces of words within verbal short-term memory, in line with the “semantic binding” hypothesis.

We studied gyrification, a marker of early developmental pathology, in high-resolution MRI scans of 34 patients with schizophrenia, 17 euthymic bipolar l disorder patients with previous psychotic symptoms, and 34 matched healthy controls in order to test the hypothesis of overlapping and diverging prefrontal gyrification abnormalities. We applied a novel, validated method for measuring local gyrification in each vertex point of the reconstructed cortical surface. Psychotic bipolar l patients had higher gyrification in dorsal anterior and infragenual cingulate cortex compared to either schizophrenia or healthy controls, while schizophrenia patients had higher gyrification than controls in anterior medial (BA 10) and orbitofrontal areas, altogether indicating diseasespecific alterations in the prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate gyrification changes in a specific subgroup of bipolar 1 disorder to affect an area relevant to emotion regulation, and distinct from changes seen in schizophrenia.

Abnormalities in neural circuits underlying affect regulation have been observed in BD, specifically in the structure and function of the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex (OFC). Fear extinction is an automatic affect regulatory process relying on neural circuits that are abnormal in BD. Thus, fear extinction might be useful in probing automatic affect regulation deficits in BD. We tested the hypothesis that BD is associated with reduced ability to extinguish fear responses. Methods: We examined fear conditioning, extinction, and extinction memory recall in a sample of stable, euthymic participants with BD (n =19) vs healthy comparison participants (n=32). A limited number of subjects (BD: n=12; healthy comparison: n=11) underwent structural NRI scanning to examine cortical size associations with extinction recall. Results: Both healthy comparison and BD participants were successful in acquiring a fear response, but BD participants responded with greater startle to both threat and safety cues. Both groups showed significant extinction. The BD group showed superior extinction recall. Extinction recall was associated with right rostral middle frontal cortex thickness across groups, whereas right OK surface area was associated with recall only in healthy comparisons. Limitations: Limitations include use of a stable, highly screened sample and a relatively small number of participants available for MRI analysis. Conclusions: Increased fear reactivity may be related to a “trait” disruption in BD patients similar to that previously described in anxiety disorders. This task may be useful for probing automatic affect regulatory processes in BD, and understanding treatment response.

This study tested the hypothesis that intravenous exogenous ghrelin administration acutely decreases endogenous serum leptin levels, and that changes in leptin levels negatively correlate with alcohol craving. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory study. Non-treatment-seeking, alcohol-dependent, heavy drinkers (n = 45) were randomized to receive intravenous ghrelin or placebo, followed by a cue-reactivity procedure, during which participants were exposed to neutral (juice) and alcohol trial cues. There was a main effect for intravenous ghrelin administration, compared with placebo, in reducing serum leptin levels (P<0.01). Post hoc analysis showed significant differences in serum leptin levels at the alcohol trial (P<0.05) that persisted at the end of the experiment (P<0.05). By contrast, there were no significant differences in serum leptin levels at the juice trial (P = not significant (NS)). The change of serum leptin level at the alcohol trial correlated with the increase in alcohol urge (P<0.05), whereas urge to drink juice was not correlated with the leptin change at the juice trial (P = NS). These findings provide preliminary evidence of ghrelin-leptin cross-talk in alcoholic individuals and suggest that their relationship may have a role in alcohol craving.","2015-09-29","2018-12-21 17:59:22","2018-12-21 17:59:22","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Is there any evidence of turn-taking? The starling as an animal model","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01416","","Turn taking in conversation appears to be a common feature in various human cultures and this universality raises questions about its biological basis and evolutionary trajectory. Functional convergence is a widespread phenomenon in evolution, revealing sometimes striking functional similarities between very distant species even though the mechanisms involved may be different. Studies on mammals (including non human primates) and bird species with different levels of social coordination reveal that temporal and structural regularities in vocal interactions may depend on the species' social structure. Here we test the hypothesis that turn-taking and associated rules of conversations may be an adaptive response to the requirements of social life, by testing the applicability of turn-taking rules to an animal model, the European starling. Birdsong has for many decades been considered as one of the best models of human language and starling songs have been well described in terms of vocal production and perception. Starlings do have vocal interactions where alternating patterns predominate. Observational and experimental data on vocal interactions reveal that (1) there are indeed clear temporal and structural regularities, (2) the temporal and structural patterning is influenced by the immediate social context, the general social situation, the individual history, and the internal state of the emitter. Comparison of phylogenetically close species of Sturnids reveals that the alternating pattern of vocal interactions varies greatly according to the species' social structure, suggesting that interactional regularities may have evolved together with social systems. These findings lead to solid bases of discussion on the evolution of communication rules in relation to social evolution. They will be discussed also in terms of processes, at the light of recent neurobiological findings.","2015-09-28","2018-12-21 17:59:22","2018-12-21 17:59:22","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","birdsong; conversation rules; mammals; sturnids; turn-taking; vocal interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The MIA rodent model provides a valuable tool to directly test the postnatal consequences of exposure to an early inflammatory insult; and examine novel preventative strategies. Here we tested the hypotheses that behavioural differences in the MIA mouse model are accompanied by in vivo and ex vivo alterations in brain biochemistry; and that these can be prevented by a post-weaning diet enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). The viral analogue PolyI:C (POL) or saline (SAL) was administered to pregnant mice on gestation day 9. Half the resulting male offspring (POL = 21; SAL = 17) were weaned onto a conventional lab diet (n-6 PUFA); half were weaned onto n-3 PUFA-enriched diet. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures were acquired prior to behavioural tests; glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD(67)) and tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels were measured ex vivo. The main findings were: (i) Adult MIA-exposed mice fed a standard diet had greater N-acetylaspartate/creatine (Cr) and lower myo-inositol/Cr levels in the cingulate cortex in vivo. (ii) The extent of these metabolite differences was correlated with impairment in prepulse inhibition. (iii) MIA-exposed mice on the control diet also had higher levels of anxiety and altered levels of GAD(67) ex vivo. (iv) An n-3 PUFA diet prevented all the in vivo and ex vivo effects of MIA observed. Thus, n-3 PUFA dietary enrichment from early life may offer a relatively safe and non-toxic approach to limit the otherwise persistent behavioural and biochemical consequences of prenatal exposure to inflammation. This result may have translational importance.","2015-09-22","2018-12-21 17:59:23","2018-12-21 17:59:23","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants produced gestures from pictures with no words presented or spoken. Same pictures and gestures but different training labels were used. Phonologically similar labels led to more errors in subsequent gestures. Thus, phonological similarity affects gesture production in the absence of speech. Are manual gestures affected by inner speech? This study tested the hypothesis that phonological form influences gesture by investigating whether phonological similarity between words that describe motion gestures creates interference for production of those gestures in the absence of overt speech. Participants learned to respond to a picture of a bottle by gesturing to open the bottle's cap, and to a picture of long hair by gesturing to twirl the hair. In one condition, the gestures were introduced with phonologically-similar labels “twist” and “twirl” (similar condition), while in the other condition, they were introduced with phonologically-dissimilar labels “unscrew” and “twirl” (dissimilar condition). During the actual experiment, labels were not produced and participants only gestured by looking at pictures. In both conditions, participants also gestured to a control pair that was used as a baseline. Participants made significantly more errors on gestures in the similar than dissimilar condition after correction for baseline differences. This finding shows the influence of phonology on gesture production in the absence of overt speech and poses new constraints on the locus of the interaction between language and gesture systems.","2015-09-09","2018-12-21 17:59:23","2018-12-21 17:59:23","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","gesture; gesture-language interaction; phonological similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While amusia has marked effects on music perception, its impact on speech perception is less clear. Here we test the hypothesis that individual differences in pitch perception affect judgment of emotion in speech, by applying low-pass filters to spoken statements of emotional speech. A norming study was first conducted on Mechanical Turk to ensure that the intended emotions from the Macquarie Battery for Evaluation of Prosody were reliably identifiable by US English speakers. The most reliably identified emotional speech samples were used in Experiment 1, in which subjects performed a psychophysical pitch discrimination task, and an emotion identification task under low-pass and unfiltered speech conditions. Results showed a significant correlation between pitch-discrimination threshold and emotion identification accuracy for low-pass filtered speech, with amusics (defined here as those with a pitch discrimination threshold >16 Hz) performing worse than controls. This relationship with pitch discrimination was not seen in unfiltered speech conditions. Given the dissociation between low-pass filtered and unfiltered speech conditions, we inferred that amusics may be compensating for poorer pitch perception by using speech cues that are filtered out in this manipulation. To assess this potential compensation, Experiment 2 was conducted using high-pass filtered speech samples intended to isolate non-pitch cues. No significant correlation was found between pitch discrimination and emotion identification accuracy for high-pass filtered speech. Results from these experiments suggest an influence of low frequency information in identifying emotional content of speech.","2015-09-08","2018-12-21 17:59:23","2018-12-21 17:59:23","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","amusia; emotion; filtering; frequency; pitch; speech; tone-deafness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep have been implicated with offline re-activation and reorganization of memories supporting explicit knowledge generation. According to two-stage models of sleep function, offline processing of information during sleep is sequential requiring multiple cycles of N REM and REM sleep stages. However, the role of overnight dynamic sleep macrostructure for insightfulness has not been studied so far. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that the frequency of interactions between NREM and REM sleep stages might be critical for awareness after sleep. For that aim, the rate of sleep stage transitions was evaluated in 53 participants who learned implicitly a serial reaction time task (SRTT) in which a determined sequence was inserted. The amount of explicit knowledge about the sequence was established by verbal recall after a night of sleep following SRTT learning. Polysomnography was recorded in this night and in a control night before and was analyzed to compare the rate of sleep-stage transitions between participants who did or did not gain awareness of task regularity after sleep. Indeed, individual ability of explicit knowledge generation was strongly associated with increased rate of transitions between NREM and REM sleep stages and between light sleep stages and slow wave sleep. However, the rate of N REM REM transitions specifically predicted the amount of explicit knowledge after sleep in a trait-dependent way. These results demonstrate that enhanced lability of sleep goes along with individual ability of knowledge awareness. Observations suggest that facilitated dynamic interactions between sleep stages, particularly between NREM and REM sleep stages play a role for offline processing which promotes rule extraction and awareness.","2015-09-07","2018-12-21 17:59:23","2018-12-21 17:59:23","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","explicit knowledge; insight; labile sleep; NREM-REM-NREM transitions; serial reaction time task; sleep stage transitions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both have to be matched when planning to grasp an object. According to the simulation hypothesis, humans simulate the action outcome for each of the grasp options to select the best grasp. However, if an object offers many different grasp options, further processing is necessary to reduce the number of possibilities. According to the preference hypothesis, a preferred grasp is first computed and then adjusted to comply with the objects' shape, if necessary. To test the hypotheses, we asked participants to grasp knobs that could be grasped with two, four, or an unconstrained range of grasps. When participants chose among two or four options, planning time increased with the number of possible grasps which is in line with the simulation hypothesis. However, when grasps were unconstrained, planning times were as short as in the two-grasp condition, suggesting another-possibly preference-based-selection process in this case. In contrast to planning time, grasp choices were comparable regardless of the knob's shape. This suggests a common criterion most likely determined grasp selection in all conditions.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:24","2018-12-21 17:59:24","","S249-S253","","1, SI","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Affordance; End-state comfort; Grasping; Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A former research shows how tweets can be used to estimate private points of interest. Authors' aim was to demonstrate, as they extend the analysis to a wider statistical base, how social maps and Web applications could be used in investigative analysis and spatial cognition research. A total of 100 Twitter accounts with approximately 250 tweets each were submitted to common geographical techniques (measures such as Convex-Hull, Mean-Center, Median-Center, Standard-Deviation-Ellipse) in order to test the hypothesis that user areas of activity are predictable. Predictions were tested through a set of specific information: clear reference to areas of activity and clear reference about user's residence. Simple algorithms and procedures demonstrated that they could be used to predict where SM users live, giving positive results in about 4/5 cases and giving indications about their home location. In fact, all home positions were found in the Convex-Hull and most of them in the Standard-Deviation-Ellipse. Furthermore, in up to 80 % of cases, houses were found within a buffer zone of 1.500 m with Median-Center as centrum (70 % using Median-Center as centrum) with a minimum effectiveness threshold of 12-13 tweets. SM may help in studying people mobility and their cognition of space and, moreover, where they live, or their traveling behavior. The processing of geographical data in conjunction with the SM analysis may facilitate the construction of models describing specific behavior of people. The use of geographical information system tools and SM analysis represents an effective approach in order to acquire spatial and territorial information, referred to social relationship. The results may be used successfully in the understanding of social dynamics and for the prevention of criminal behavior.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:24","2018-12-21 17:59:24","","S299-S303","","1, SI","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Geographical Profiling; Open Source Intelligence; Social media; Social Network Analysis; Socio-Spatial Intelligence; Spatial Analysis; Spatial cognition; Territorial behavioral analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research so far pointed out different aspects of this large phenomenon. On the one hand, some scholars have argued that social support is a key factor to foster learning and persistence. On the other hand, some other scholars have rather highlighted the role of student motivation and engagement itself in improving performance on academic tasks. In this article, we tested theoretical models that combine the two approaches in a whole process. Aims. - We aimed at clarifying (1) the specific contribution of several sources of perceived social support to academic performance, and (2) the mediation role of motivation and engagement in the relationships between perceived social support and performance. Method. - The sample consisted of 226 last year university students. Structural equation modeling analyses were used to test the hypothesized associations. Results. - Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that institutional and supervisor support were associated with motivation, which in turn predicted greater behavioral, cognitive and emotional engagement. Further, behavioral engagement was the unique contributor of academic performance at the master's thesis. Conclusion. - The results clarify the specific contribution of different sources of perceived social support and underline the importance of the supervisor and the institution. They also underline the importance of considering different sources of perceived social support at the same time.

The Relational and Item-Specific Encoding (RiSE) paradigm has been used to disentangle these encoding and retrieval processes, which may depend on specific medial temporal lobe (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging during RiSE task performance could help to specify dysfunctional neural circuits in schizophrenia that can be targeted for interventions to improve memory and functioning in the illness. OBJECTIVES To use fMRI to test the hypothesis that schizophrenia disproportionately affects MTL and PFC subregions during relational encoding and retrieval relative to item-specific memory processes, and to use fMRI results from healthy individuals serving as controls to establish neural construct validity for RiSE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multisite, case-control, cross-sectional fMRI study was conducted between November 1, 2010, and May 30, 2012, at 5 Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical Applications for Schizophrenia sites. The final sample included 52 outpatients with clinically stable schizophrenia and 57 demographically matched healthy control participants. Data analysis was performed between February 1, 2013, and May 30, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Behavioral performance speed and accuracy (d') on item recognition and associative recognition tasks. Voxelwise statistical parametric maps for a priori MTL and PFC regions of interest to test activation differences between relational and item-specific memory during encoding and retrieval. RESULTS Item recognition was disproportionately impaired in patients with schizophrenia relative to healthy control participants following relational encoding (F-1,F-107 = 4.7; P = .03). The differential deficit was accompanied by reduced dorsolateral PFC activation during relational encoding in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy control participants (z > 2.3; P < .05 corrected). Retrieval success (hits > misses) was associated with hippocampal activation in healthy control participants during relational item recognition and associative recognition conditions, and hippocampal activation was specifically reduced in schizophrenia for recognition of relational but not item-specific information (z > 2.3; P < .05 corrected). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this unique, multisite fMRI study, results in the healthy control group supported RiSE construct validity by revealing expected memory effects in PFC and MTL subregions during encoding and retrieval. Comparison of schizophrenic and healthy control participants revealed disproportionate memory deficits in schizophrenia for relational vs item-specific information, accompanied by regionally and functionally specific deficits in dorsolateral PFC and hippocampal activation.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:26","2018-12-21 17:59:26","","909-916","","9","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: This study included 89 toddlers and mothers from low-income families. Behavioral problems were rated at 2 time points by masters-level trained Early Head Start home visiting specialists. Maternal emotion talk was coded from a wordless book-sharing task. Coding focused on mothers' emotion bridging, which included labeling emotions, explaining the context of emotions, noting the behavioral cues of emotions, and linking emotions to toddlers' own experiences. Maternal demographic risk reflected a composite score of 5 risk factors. Results: A significant 3-way interaction between Time 1 toddler behavior problems, maternal emotion talk, and maternal demographic risk (p = .001) and examination of slope difference tests revealed that when maternal demographic risk was greater, more maternal emotion talk buffered associations between earlier and later behavior problems. Greater demographic risk and lower maternal emotion talk intensified Time 1 behavior problems as a predictor of Time 2 behavior problems. The model explained 54% of the variance in toddlers' Time 2 behavior problems. Analyses controlled for maternal warmth to better examine the unique contributions of emotion bridging to toddlers' behaviors. Conclusion: Toddlers at highest risk, those with more early behavioral problems from higher demographic-risk families, benefit the most from mothers' emotion talk. Informing parents about the use of emotion talk may be a cost-effective, simple strategy to support at-risk toddlers' social-emotional development and reduce behavioral problems.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:26","2018-12-21 17:59:26","","512-520","","7","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chaining models predict that when participants erroneously recall an item too early, recall should proceed from the point of error. In contradiction to such a prediction, Henson found evidence for a fill-in effect: participants were much more likely to revisit an erroneously skipped item than to continue onward to later list items. However, recent reanalyses of serial recall data sets have found evidence for the opposite pattern in serial recall experiments that use open sets of items. We tested the hypothesis that open sets of items produce fill-in effects by comparing serial recall with an open set and a closed set, and when participants were allowed and prohibited from skipping over responses, and comparing serial recall with a reconstruction of order task. Fill-in effects were observed in all cases except when participants were not encouraged to skip over responses. Subsequent analyses indicated that when omission rates were equated, a fill-in effect was observed for all conditions when lists contained no omissions. These results suggest that high omission rates in open-set designs obscure a fill-in effect and further sound a cautionary note about interpreting cases in which recall continues in the forward direction after a skipped response.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:27","2018-12-21 17:59:27","","1447-1455","","5","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","chaining models; conditional response probabilities; fill-in effects; serial recall","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used recently-developed actor-partner-interdependence mediational models with data from a 35-day dyadic diary study of 80 committed couples. Social anxiety was found to be tied to poor relationship satisfaction in the daily lives of both persons with SA (actors) and their partners.

Existing latent variable methods for estimating G x E interactions in twin and family data specify parametric (typically linear) functions for the interaction effect. An improper functional form may obscure the underlying shape of the interaction effect and may lead to failures to detect a significant interaction. In this article, we introduce a novel approach to the behavior genetic toolkit, local structural equation modeling (LOSEM). LOSEM is a highly flexible nonparametric approach for estimating latent interaction effects across the range of a measured moderator. This approach opens up the ability to detect and visualize new forms of G x E interaction. We illustrate the approach by using LOSEM to estimate gene x socioeconomic status interactions for six cognitive phenotypes. Rather than continuously and monotonically varying effects as has been assumed in conventional parametric approaches, LOSEM indicated substantial nonlinear shifts in genetic variance for several phenotypes. The operating characteristics of LOSEM were interrogated through simulation studies where the functional form of the interaction effect was known. LOSEM provides a conservative estimate of G x E interaction with sufficient power to detect statistically significant G x E signal with moderate sample size. We offer recommendations for the application of LOSEM and provide scripts for implementing these biometric models in Mplus and in OpenMx under R.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:27","2018-12-21 17:59:27","","581-596","","5","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive ability; Gene x environment interaction; Kernel regression; LOESS; LOSEM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the mRNA expression of membrane-bound receptors for proinflammatory cytokines will be altered in the lymphocytes of patients with BP. MethodsWe determined protein and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and mRNA expression of their receptors in the lymphocytes from 29 drug-free, hospitalized patients with BP and 30 drug-free normal control subjects. The subjects were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Plasma protein levels of cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); mRNA levels in lymphocytes were determined by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. ResultsWe found that mean mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and their receptors TNFR1, IL-1R1, and the antagonist IL-1RA were significantly higher in the lymphocytes of patients with BP compared with normal controls. ConclusionsThis study suggests that the observed abnormalities of membrane-bound cytokine receptors may alter the functional response of cytokines in BP and that the mRNA levels of these receptors could be a potential biomarker.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:28","2018-12-21 17:59:28","","636-644","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","biomarkers; bipolar illness; cytokine receptors; gene expression; interleukin-1 receptors; interleukin-6 receptors; lymphocytes; mRNA; proinflammatory cytokines; tumor necrosis factor- receptors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated the relationship in a large, consecutive, retrospective sample of patients receiving ECT in Aberdeen. We have tested the hypotheses of previous authors to further examine the relationship between seizure and therapeutic effect as well as discuss the potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Methods All patients receiving ECT at the Royal Cornhill Hospital between 2000 and the end of 2008 were identified from the Scottish ECT Accreditation Network. Electroconvulsive therapy was administered twice weekly with a bifrontotemporal electrode placement using routine dosage schedules. Data were gathered from the Scottish ECT Accreditation Network and case notes regarding ECT course and clinical effect. Results The seizure threshold increased in 219 (94.4%) patients, stayed the same in 13 (5.6%) patients, and decreased in 0 patient (n = 232). No significant relationship was present between change in seizure threshold and change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score (P = 0.39; Kendall b r = 0.047; n = 182), although responders did display greater increase in seizure threshold than nonresponders. Conclusions Electroconvulsive therapy confers anticonvulsant effects in a consecutive sample of real-life patients. Neither initial seizure threshold nor magnitude of seizure threshold increase is a predictor of clinical response to ECT. A rise in seizure threshold is not essential for therapeutic effect but may represent an important marker of underlying neuronal state. The evidence reviewed in this article supports a link between neuroplastic effects of ECT and the evidenced rise in seizure threshold.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:29","2018-12-21 17:59:29","","173-178","","3","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","electroconvulsive therapy; seizure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research consistently shows that the motor intention enters awareness a few 100 ms before movement onset. As research in other domains has shown that most behavior is affected by the emotional state people are in, it is remarkable that the role of emotional states on intention awareness has never been investigated. Here we tested the hypothesis that positive and negative affects have opposite effects on the temporal relationship between the conscious intention to act and the action itself. A mood induction procedure that combined guided imagery and music listening was employed to induce positive, negative, or neutral affective states. After each mood induction session, participants were asked to execute voluntary self-paced movements and to report when they formed the intention to act. Exposure to pleasant material, as compared to exposure to unpleasant material, enhanced positive affect and dampened negative affect. Importantly, in the positive affect condition participants reported their intention to act earlier in time with respect to action onset, as compared to when they were in the negative or in the neutral affect conditions. Conversely the reported time of the intention to act when participants experienced negative affect did not differ significantly from the neutral condition. These findings suggest that the temporal relationship between the conscious intention to act and the action itself is malleable to changes in affective states and may indicate that positive affect enhances intentional awareness.","2015-09-01","2018-12-21 17:59:29","2018-12-21 17:59:29","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","action control; conscious awareness; intention; intentional action; Libet task; positive affect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test the hypothesis that suicidality and EDs share genetic risk contributing to the expression of both phenotypes. MethodFemale twins (N=1,002) from the Australian Twin Registry, aged 28-40 years, were interviewed with diagnostic interviews. Lifetime diagnostic information relating to eating disorders [anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder, and purging disorder (PD)], suicidality (ranging transitory thoughts to suicide attempts), and major depression. ResultsAny suicidal thoughts were reported by 24% of the sample, but prevalence of lifetime suicidality among female twins with EDs was much higher (43%), presence of an ED diagnosis more than doubling likelihood of suicidality (OR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.63-3.31). AN and BN conveyed greatest risk of suicidality (OR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.06-3.87; OR=3.97, 95% CI: 2.01-7.85, respectively). Twin phenotype correlations showed monozygotic twins had uniformly higher estimates than dizygotic counterparts.

DiscussionBoth cross twin phenotypic correlations and genetic modeling infer a common genetic pathway for suicidality and EDs, but further investigation is needed to elucidate whether this may constitute emotional dysregulation or other temperament-linked factors.

Since sleep is a process that is crucial for affective homeostasis, disturbed sleep in healthy individuals may be a risk factor for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder. Utilizing data from a large cohort of adolescents and young adults, this study tests the hypothesis that disturbed sleep constitutes a risk factor for the later onset of bipolar disorder. A representative community sample of N = 3021 adolescents and young adults (baseline age 14-24) was assessed using the standardized Composite International Diagnostic Interview and followed-up prospectively up to 3 times over up to 10 years. Disturbed sleep at baseline was quantified utilizing the corresponding items from the self-report inventory SCL-90-R. The compound value (insomnia-score) as an ordinal parameter for the severity of sleep disturbances was used to assess associations with the incidence of bipolar disorder among participants free of major mental disorder at baseline (N = 1943) using odds ratios (OR) from logistic regressions. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, parental mood disorder and lifetime alcohol or cannabis dependence. Poor sleep quality significantly increased the risk for the subsequent development of bipolar disorder (OR = 1.75; p = 0.001). Regarding individual sleep items, trouble falling asleep and early morning awakening were predictive for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder. Disturbed sleep in persons otherwise free of major mental disorders appears to confer an increased risk for the subsequent onset of bipolar disorder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the relationship between patients' object relations and interpersonal process in psychotherapy. Namely, we tested the hypothesis that the quality of patients' object relations is positively associated with both patient- and therapist-rated alliance quality. Design. Psychotherapy was administered naturalistically, with quantitative data collection before and during treatment. Methods. Participants included 73 adult outpatients and 23 therapists at two mental health clinics. Using the Bell Object Relations and Reality Testing Inventory, we measured four dimensions of patients' object relations at baselinealienation, insecure attachment, egocentricity, and social incompetence. Using the Working Alliance Inventory, we measured alliance from patient and therapist perspectives. Control variables included time, patient demographics, symptom severity, and clinic. We employed hierarchical linear modelling to analyse data with a nested structure, with 138 sessions at Level 1, 73 patients at Level 2, and 23 therapists at Level 3. Results. Patient alienation and insecure attachment were associated with lower patient-rated alliance, while egocentricity was associated with higher patient-rated alliance. Patients' object relations were not significantly associated with therapist-rated alliance. On average, patients perceived the alliance more positively than their therapists, with a weak positive correlation between the alliance perspectives. Conclusions. The results suggest that object relation dimensions may be important patient characteristics for forecasting therapeutic relationship quality. They also call for more attention to differences between alliance rating perspectives.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:31","2018-12-21 17:59:31","","254-269","","3","88","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alienation; alliance; egocentrism; hierarchical linear modelling; insecure attachment; patient object relations; social incompetence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also tested the hypothesis that the relation between social class and values would be mediated by workplace experiences. Participants included 68 parents (38 mothers, 30 fathers; 46 working class, 22 middle class) of 36-month-old children who were part of a longitudinal study. Correlation analyses revealed few associations among social class, workplace experiences, and child-rearing values among the mothers, but among the fathers these variables associated in the expected direction.

That is, drink has two arguments because drink specifies two participants: someone who drinks and something that gets drunk. This correspondence does not appear to hold, however, in the case of instrumental participants, e.g. John drank the soda with a straw. Verbs such as slice and write have been argued to specify an instrumental participant, even though instruments do not pattern like arguments given other criteria. In this paper, we investigated how instrumental verbs are represented, testing the hypothesis that verbs such as slice encode three participants in the same way that dative verbs such as lend encode three participants. In two experiments English-speakers reported their judgments about the number of participants specified by a verb, e.g. that drink specifies two participants. These judgments indicate that slice does not encode three distinct arguments. Nonetheless, some verbs were systematically more likely to elicit the judgment that the instrument is specified by the verb, a pattern that held across individual subjects. To account for these findings, we propose that instruments are not independent verbal arguments but are represented in a gradient away: an instrument may be a more or less salient part of the force exerted by an agent. These results inform our understanding of the relationship between argument structure and event representation, raising questions concerning the role of arguments in language processing and learning.

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that sexual desires would be positively related to infidelity and courting intentions, but only when self-control was dispositionally low or temporarily impaired. MethodIn Study 1, 331 participants who were recruited online completed survey measures of dispositional self-control, general sexual desire, and past infidelity. In Study 2, 120 undergraduate students were randomly allocated to either a depletion (low self-control) or control (high self-control) condition. Following the self-control manipulation, all participants completed implicit and explicit measures of courting intentions, and indicated the likelihood they would cheat on a long-term partner in an imagined scenario. ResultsStudy 1 found that sexual desire positively predicted reported infidelity frequency for people with low, but not high, dispositional self-control. Study 2 found that stronger sexual desires predicted increased infidelity intentions, sitting closer to an attractive stranger in an imagined scenario, and asking this person out in a hypothetical encounter, but only among people who had been depleted of their self-control resources. Sexual desires were unrelated to all constructs when participants' self-control was dispositionally high (Study 1) or not depleted (Study 2). ConclusionsOur findings suggest that when self-control is high, sexual behaviour may be largely divorced from desire, relying instead on analysis of situational or other cognitive factors. Sexual behaviour may reflect genuine sexual predispositions, however, when self-control is dispositionally low or temporarily depleted.","2015-09","2018-12-21 17:59:34","2018-12-21 17:59:34","","178-186","","3","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ego depletion; self-control; self-regulation; sexual behaviour; sexual desire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study examined whether two types of self-esteem (personal and relational) would mediate the relationship between four loci-of-hope (internal, family, peers, and spiritual) and life satisfaction among Hong Kong and Macau college students (n = 1008). Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypotheses. Consistent with the hypotheses, both personal self-esteem and relational self-esteem partially mediated the effects of internal hope on life satisfaction. Moreover, relational self-esteem mediated the effect of external-family locus-of-hope on life satisfaction. Interestingly, a suppressing effect of personal self-esteem on the relationship between external-peers locus-of-hope and life satisfaction was found.

This study aimed to test the hypotheses that delusional conviction is less responsive to antipsychotic treatment than delusional distress and preoccupation, and that depression and anxiety reduce alongside improvements in delusional dimensions. Forty acutely ill inpatients with delusions were assessed during their early stage of antipsychotic treatment. Interview data were analysed using mixed models for repeated measures. There was a significant reduction in psychotic symptoms over eight weeks, after controlling for baseline dosage of antipsychotics. We found no differential rate of improvement across delusional dimensions, and all dimensions improved over time. However, conviction ratings remained relatively high throughout the eight weeks. There was no significant improvement in anxiety and depression, and delusional preoccupation covaried with anxiety and depression throughout eight weeks, suggesting a relationship between emotional and delusional processes during the early recovery phase of psychosis.

Evidence in humans and songbirds","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01243","","Different speakers produce the same speech sound differently, yet listeners are still able to reliably identify the speech sound. How listeners can adjust their perception to compensate for speaker differences in speech, and whether these compensatory processes are unique only to humans, is still not fully understood. In this study we compare the ability of humans and zebra finches to categorize vowels despite speaker variation in speech in order to test the hypothesis that accommodating speaker and gender differences in isolated vowels can be achieved without prior experience with speaker-related variability. Using a behavioral Go/No-go task and identical stimuli, we compared Australian English adults' (naive to Dutch) and zebra finches' (naive to human speech) ability to categorize /I/ and /epsilon/ vowels of an novel Dutch speaker after learning to discriminate those vowels from only one other speaker. Experiments 1 and 2 presented vowels of two speakers interspersed or blocked, respectively. Results demonstrate that categorization of vowels is possible without prior exposure to speaker-related variability in speech for zebra finches, and in non-native vowel categories for humans. Therefore, this study is the first to provide evidence for what might be a species-shared auditory bias that may supersede speaker-related information during vowel categorization. It additionally provides behavioral evidence contradicting a prior hypothesis that accommodation of speaker differences is achieved via the use of formant ratios. Therefore, investigations of alternative accounts of vowel normalization that incorporate the possibility of an auditory bias for disregarding inter-speaker variability are warranted.","2015-08-25","2018-12-21 17:59:36","2018-12-21 17:59:36","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","comparative cognition; speech perception; vowel categorization; vowel normalization; zebra finch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that uric acid levels are higher in subjects with schizophrenia treated with clozapine than in healthy control and they correlate with anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests and results of bioimpedance analysis of body composition. Methods. Data for 24 subjects with schizophrenia treated with clozapine and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers was analyzed. Results. There was no difference of fasting uric acid concentrations between clozapine and control groups (4.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.3 mg/dl, P = 0.87). Regarding the whole group, uric acid levels were significantly higher in men (5.2 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.9, P < 0.001). Uric acid levels correlated with weight (R = 0.58, P = 0.003), body mass index (BMI; R = 0.49, P = 0.01), abdominal circumference (R = 0.45, P = 0.03), waist circumference (R = 0.47, P = 0.02), waist-to-hip ratio (R = 0.42, P = 0.04), insulin (R = 0.50, P = 0.01), homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 2 (HOMA2-IR; R = 0.49, P = 0.01), basal metabolic rate (R = 0.56, P = 0.004), lean body mass (R = 0.55, P = 0.005) and body water (R = 0.55, P = 0.005). There were no significant differences of uric acid levels for smoking status, impaired fasting glucose, abdominal obesity, obesity/overweight and dyslipidemia. Uric acid levels did not correlate with age, duration of clozapine treatment, clozapine dose, leg circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total body fat, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), homocysteine, corrected calcium, glucose and homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 1 (HOMA1-IR). Conclusions. We did not find significant differences in blood uric acid levels between subjects with schizophrenia and controls. Association with weight, BMI, abdominal and waist circumferences, insulin levels and insulin resistance may support uric acid role as an important cardiovascular risk factor. Association with lean weight may explain why men have higher levels of uric acid than women.","2015-08-18","2018-12-21 17:59:37","2018-12-21 17:59:37","","1735-1740","","6","69","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Clozapine; Metabolic syndrome; Schizophrenia; Uric acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If drivers' yielding behavior results in differential behavior toward Black and White pedestrians, this may lead to disparate pedestrian crossing experiences based on race and potentially contribute to disproportionate safety outcomes for minorities. We tested the hypothesis that drivers' yielding behavior is influenced by pedestrians' race in a controlled field experiment at an unsignalized midblock marked crosswalk in downtown Portland, Oregon. Six trained male research team participants (3 White, 3 Black) simulated an individual pedestrian crossing, while trained observers cataloged the number of cars that passed and the time until a driver yielded. Results (88 pedestrian trials, 173 driver-subjects) revealed that Black pedestrians were passed by twice as many cars and experienced wait times that were 32% longer than White pedestrians. Results support the hypothesis that minority pedestrians experience discriminatory treatment by drivers at crosswalks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In two studies, women's gender identification moderated the extent to which they favored men over women when they advanced in a male-dominated field. Specifically, the weaker women's gender identification, the more favoritism they showed for a male relative to a female subordinate. Gender identification did not moderate women's behavior in a context in which women were not underrepresented, pointing to the power of the situation in eliciting this relationship.

This study tested the hypothesis that pupil responses to threat would be significantly larger in trauma-exposed individuals with PTSD compared to those without PTSD. Eye-tracking technology was used to evaluate pupil response to threatening and neutral images. Recruited for participation were 40 trauma-exposed individuals; 40.0% (n = 16) met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Individuals with PTSD showed significantly more pupil dilation to threat-relevant stimuli compared to the neutral elements (Cohen's d = 0.76), and to trauma-exposed controls (Cohen's d = 0.75). Pupil dilation significantly accounted for 12% of variability in PTSD after time elapsed since most recent trauma, cumulative violence exposure, and trait anxiety were statistically adjusted. The final logistic regression model was associated with 85% of variability in PTSD status and correctly classified 93.8% of individuals with PTSD and 95.8% of those without.

The current study examined the relationship between undifferentiated negative affect and impulsivity. Participants with a current BPD (n = 67) or depressive disorder (DD; n = 38) diagnosis carried an electronic diary for 28 days, reporting on emotions and impulsivity when randomly prompted (up to 6 times per day). Undifferentiated negative affect was quantified using momentary intraclass correlation coefficients, which indicated how consistently negative emotion items were rated across fear, hostility, and sadness subscales. Undifferentiated negative affect at the occasion-level, day-level, and across 28 days was used to predict occasion-level impulsivity. Multilevel modeling was used to test the hypothesis that undifferentiated negative emotion would be a significant predictor of momentary impulsivity above and beyond levels of overall negative affect. Undifferentiated negative affect at the occasion and day levels were significant predictors of occasion-level impulsivity, but undifferentiated negative affect across the 28-day study period was only marginally significant. Results did not differ depending on BPD or DD status, though individuals with BPD did report significantly greater momentary impulsivity and undifferentiated negative affect. Undifferentiated negative affect may increase risk for impulsivity among individuals with BPD and depressive disorders, and the current data suggest that this process can be relatively immediate as well as cumulative over the course of a day. This research supports the consideration of undifferentiated negative affect as a transdiagnostic construct, but one that may be particularly relevant for those with BPD.","2015-08","2018-12-21 17:59:40","2018-12-21 17:59:40","","740-753","","3","124","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","borderline personality disorder; depressive disorder; ecological momentary assessment; emotion differentiation; emotional granularity; impulsivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among patients with schizophrenia who were antipsychotic drug-naive or drug-free and their siblings for comparison with healthy controls. Methods: One-hundred-two patients with schizophrenia (drug-naive or drug-free), 64 siblings and 70 age-matched healthy subjects were recruited for this case-control study. Metabolic syndrome was assessed based on Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, adapted ATP III and International Diabetes Federation criteria. Student's t-tests, chi-squared tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests and Bonferroni corrections were used as appropriate. Results: The diagnoses of metabolic syndrome and metabolic disturbances as a subsyndromal state were found to be significantly more frequent in patients and their siblings than in the controls. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and disturbances in blood pressure put the patient group at risk for metabolic syndrome even before they were exposed to antipsychotic drugs. Conclusions: Although antipsychotic drugs have consistently been related to disturbances of glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with schizophrenia, this study showed that patients with schizophrenia and their siblings are already at a high risk for metabolic syndrome independent of any antipsychotic effects. These individuals should be monitored regularly following a diagnosis of schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In Study 1, 263 early adolescents (M age = 12.62 years), mothers, and fathers completed surveys of family and child functioning at 2 measurement occasions spaced 2 years apart. In Study 2, 243 preschool children (M age = 4.60 years) participated in a multimethod (i.e., observations, structured interview, surveys) measurement battery to assess family functioning, children's reactivity to interparental conflict, and their psychological adjustment. Across both studies, latent difference score analyses revealed that involvement moderated associations between emotional reactivity and children's increases in psychological (i.e., internalizing and externalizing) problems. Children's emotional reactivity to interparental conflict was a significantly stronger predictor of their psychological maladjustment when they were highly involved in the conflicts. In addition, the developmental benefits and costs of involvement varied as a function of emotional reactivity. Involvement in interparental conflict predicted increases in psychological problems for children experiencing high emotional reactivity and decreases in psychological problems when they exhibited low emotional reactivity.

This was done by independently manipulating two factors that affect effort: task load and task motivation. A total of 28 participants were tested in a mixed 3 x 2 factorial design; task load (within-Ss) was varied in terms of the number of manual control systems (1, 3 or 5) that needed to be managed during a 100 min session, while task motivation (between-Ss) was defined by instructions (standard vs. enhanced) designed to influence the level of voluntary commitment to task goals. Effort and fatigue were measured by self report, as were perceived demands and anxiety (included as manipulation checks). While both task load and task motivation led to an increase in effort, there was a stronger fatigue response to task load under enhanced task motivation. As predicted, while both perceived demands and anxiety increased with task load, they were not affected by task motivation. An independent assessment of after-effects of fatigue on a fault finding task showed an increased use of low effort strategies under enhanced task motivation. The findings support the hypothesized effort -> fatigue linkage. During task performance, fatigue is a consequence not of task demands per se, but of the level of commitment of effort in meeting demands.","2015-08","2018-12-21 17:59:45","2018-12-21 17:59:45","","467-476","","4","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","After-effects; Effort; Fatigue; Task load; Task motivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these mechanisms seem to be insufficient to explain the rich flexibility shown by the affective system. Much like the multistable physiological systems that operate on different time scales under allometric control, the affective system may show multistability. In this study, we looked for the signature of multistability, i.e. scaling, to test the hypothesis that mood and anxiety fluctuations are under allometric control, and we explored the associations between scaling and several emotion regulation strategies. Thirty-two undergraduate students reported mood and anxiety scores three times per day for a period of 50 days. Each time series was analyzed to obtain the scaling exponent h. In all cases .5 < h < 1, thus lending support to the main hypothesis of the study. Anxiety scaling exponents were associated with both positive reappraisal and refocusing strategies.

In the present study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that refreshing is closely related to memory search. The assumption is that refreshing and memory search both rely on a basic covert memory process that quickly retrieves the memory items into the focus of attention, thereby reactivating the information (Cowan, 1992; Vergauwe & Cowan, 2014). Consistent with the idea that people use their attention to prevent loss from WM, previous research has shown that increasing the proportion of time during which attention is occupied by concurrent processing, thereby preventing refreshing, results in poorer recall performance in complex span tasks (Barrouillet, Portrat, & Camos, Psychological Review, 118, 175-192, 2011). Here, we tested whether recall performance is differentially affected by prolonged attentional capture caused by memory search. If memory search and refreshing both rely on retrieval from WM, then prolonged attentional capture caused by memory search should not lead to forgetting, because memory items are assumed to be reactivated during memory search, in the same way that they would be if that period of time were used for refreshing. Consistent with this idea, prolonged attentional capture had a disruptive effect when it was caused by the need to retrieve knowledge from long-term memory, but not when it was caused by the need to search through the content of WM. The present results support the idea that refreshing operates through a process of retrieval of information into the focus of attention.","2015-08","2018-12-21 17:59:46","2018-12-21 17:59:46","","1001-1006","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention and memory; Memory search; Refreshing; Short-term memory; Working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has found that elevated PTSS are associated with smoking to cope with negative affect, and it has been posited that perceptions of being unable to cope with the consequences of smoking cessation interfere with smoking cessation in this population. However, the mechanism of the relationship between PTSS and these smoking maintenance factors (i.e., smoking to reduce negative affect and barriers to cessation) has not been established. Emotion dysregulation is one potential mechanism as it is associated with PTSS as well as addictive behavior aimed at avoiding and reducing negative emotional states. Methods: We cross-sectionally tested the hypotheses that 1) PTSS and emotion dysregulation would be incrementally associated with smoking to reduce negative affect and barriers to cessation, and 2) that emotion dysregulation would mediate the relationships between PTSS, smoking to reduce negative affect, and barriers to cessation among a community sample of trauma-exposed individuals presenting for smoking cessation treatment (N = 315). Results: Results demonstrated that elevated PTSS were associated with increased smoking to reduce negative affect and barriers to cessation, and that emotion dysregulation mediated these relationships. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence of a mechanism between PTSS and psychological smoking maintenance factors, and suggest that emotion dysregulation may be a useful target for smoking cessation interventions among trauma-exposed individuals.

However, characteristics of youth with LOC-ED have not been examined. We tested the hypothesis that the proposed criteria for LOC-ED would identify children with greater adiposity, more disordered eating attitudes, and greater mood disturbance than those without LOC-ED. Participants were 251 youth (10.29 years +/-1.54, 53.8% female, 57.8% White, 35.5% Black, 2.0% Asian, 4.8% Hispanic, 53.0% overweight). Youth were interviewed regarding eating attitudes and behaviors, completed questionnaires to assess general psychopathology, and underwent measurements of body fat mass. Using previously proposed criteria for LOCED, children were classified as LOC-ED (n=19), LOC in the absence of the full disorder (subLOC, n = 33), and youth not reporting LOC (noLOC, n = 199). LOC-ED youth had higher BMIz (p = 0.001) and adiposity (p = 0.003) and reported greater disordered eating concerns (p < 0.001) compared to noLOC youth. Compared to subLOC youth, LOC-ED youth had non-significantly higher BMIz (p = 0.11), and significantly higher adiposity (p = 0.04) and disordered eating attitudes (p = 0.02). SubLOC youth had greater disordered eating concerns (p < 0.001) and BMIz (p = 0.03) but did not differ in adiposity (p = 0.33) compared to noLOC youth.

This study aimed to evaluate a prospective, mediational model of risk for the full range of binge eating and purging eating disorders, with attention to possible diagnostic differences. Specific aims were to determine, first, whether eating, weight and shape concerns at age 14 would mediate the relationship between parent-perceived childhood overweight at age 10 and a binge eating or purging eating disorder between age 15 and 20, and, second, whether this mediational model would differ across bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and purging disorder. Participants (N = 1,160; 51 % female) were drawn from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, which has followed children from pre-birth to age 20. Eating disorders were assessed via self-report questionnaires when participants were aged 14, 17 and 20. There were 146 participants (82 % female) with a binge eating or purging eating disorder with onset between age 15 and 20 [bulimia nervosa = 81 (86 % female), binge eating disorder = 43 (74 % female), purging disorder = 22 (77 % female)]. Simple mediation analysis with bootstrapping was used to test the hypothesized model of risk, with early adolescent eating, weight and shape concerns positioned as a mediator between parent-perceived childhood overweight and later onset of a binge eating or purging eating disorder. Subsequently, a conditional process model (a moderated mediation model) was specified to determine if model pathways differed significantly by eating disorder diagnosis. In the simple mediation model, there was a significant indirect effect of parent-perceived childhood overweight on risk for a binge eating or purging eating disorder in late adolescence, mediated by eating, weight and shape concerns in early adolescence. In the conditional process model, this significant indirect effect was not moderated by eating disorder group. The results support a prospective model of risk that applies to bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and purging disorder. Common prevention approaches may be possible for bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and purging disorder.","2015-08","2018-12-21 17:59:50","2018-12-21 17:59:50","","1580-1591","","8, SI","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescence; Binge eating disorder; Bulimia nervosa; Purging disorder; Raine Study; Risk factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, research has not examined the direction of this relationship using a longitudinal design. Perfectionism may be an antecedent or consequence of social anxiety, or both. Our study tested reciprocal relations between self-critical perfectionism (i.e., intense self-rebuke, negative reactions to perceived failures, and nagging self-doubt about actions) and social anxiety. We hypothesized that self-critical perfectionism would be both an antecedent and a consequence of social anxiety. A 3-wave, 12-month longitudinal design was used to test the hypotheses. Waves were spaced 6 months apart. Participants (N = 301 undergraduates) completed measures in the lab at Wave 1. Online questionnaires were administered for Waves 2 and 3. Self-critical perfectionism and social anxiety both displayed strong rank-order inter-individual stability. Social anxiety predicted increases in self-critical perfectionism. However, self-critical perfectionism did not predict change in social anxiety. Self-critical perfectionism was a consequence of, but not an antecedent of, social anxiety. Results suggest treatments that reduce social anxiety may also reduce self-critical perfectionism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study tested the hypothesis that the contingency of perceived self-worth on external factors (i.e., contingent self-esteem) predicts aggression, particularly reactive, over and above global self-esteem, and that anger rumination exacerbates this relationship. The potential moderating role of gender was also considered. Regression analyses on a sample of 729 undergraduates revealed that contingent self-esteem interacts with both anger rumination and gender to predict reactive aggression. In combination with observations for proactive aggression, results of the present study suggest that the variation in previous findings may be at least partly explained by failure to account for the influences of self-esteem contingency, gender, and functional subtypes of aggression.

Young adults (n = 233, 149 male) completed the Empathizing Quotient (EQ), the Systemizing Quotient (SQ) and the RIASEC Personality Type Inventory to assess six career interest groups. Sex differences were found on the EQ, SQ Investigative interests and interest in things, a subset of items from the Realistic scale. Mediation analyses revealed that occupational interests partially mediated the relation between sex and SQ scores, whereas controlling for Investigative interests increased the sex difference in EQ scores.

We tested the hypothesis that attachment anxiety and avoidance are differentially associated with the severity of positive, negative and general psychopathology symptoms in patients with a diagnosis of psychosis. Five hundred patients with DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnoses of psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective or non-affective psychosis) from independent samples from Netherlands, United Kingdom and Israel completed the Relationship Questionnaire. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale.

The conservative level of statistical significance was established (p < 0.001) to control for multiple testing. After adjustment for possible confounders, attachment anxiety predicted severity of positive symptoms as well as affective symptoms. Both attachment anxiety and avoidance were associated with severity of hallucinations and persecution Contrary to predictions, attachment avoidance was not associated with overall scores for negative symptoms, although there was some evidence of relatively weaker association between avoidance and social and emotional withdrawal.

Aims: To test the hypothesis that lost life years due to natural causes starts in early and mid-adulthood, supporting the hypothesis of accelerated aging. Methods: Using individual data horn nationwide registers of patient with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder we calculated remaining life expectancies before age 90 years for values of age 15, 25, 35...75 years among all individuals alive in year 2000. Further, we estimated the reduction in life expectancy due to natural causes (physical illnesses) and unnatural causes (suicide and accidents) in relation to age. Results: A total of 22,635 patients with bipolar disorder were included in the study in addition to data from the entire Danish general population of 5.4 million people. At age 15 years, remaining life expectancy before age 90 years was decreased 12.7 and 8.9 life years, respectively, for men and women with bipolar disorder. For 15-year old boys with bipolar disorder, natural causes accounted for 58% of all lost life years and for 15-year old girls, natural causes accounted for 67% increasing to 74% and 80% for 45-year old men and women, respectively. Limitations: Data concern patients who get contact to hospital psychiatry only. Conclusions: Natural causes of death is the most prevalent reason for lost life years already from adolescence and increases substantially during early and mid-adulthood, in this way supporting the hypothesis of accelerated aging. Early intervention in bipolar disorder should not only focus on improving outcome of the bipolar disorder but also on decreasing the tisk of comorbid general medical illnesses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, mechanisms linking DI to specific behaviors remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that DI is a general vulnerability that confers risk of particular avoidance behaviors via more specific, lower-order vulnerabilities. The current study examined associations between DI and worry-related cognitions. Design: A multiple mediator model tested the hypothesis that worry-related variables (intolerance of uncertainty [IU], cognitive avoidance, beliefs about worry, and negative problem orientation) mediated the association between DI and worry. Methods: An undergraduate student (n = 281) and a clinical (n = 123) sample completed self-report measures. Results: Across samples, worry was associated with higher levels of DI, IU, cognitive avoidance, beliefs about worry, and negative problem orientation. Mediation results differed somewhat between the two samples. In the undergraduate sample, IU, negative beliefs about worry, and positive beliefs about worry mediated the association between DI and worry. In the clinical sample, negative problem orientation and negative beliefs about worry mediated the association between DI and worry.

Autobiographical remembering and autobiographical knowledge as well as the stability of bodily integrity, of social roles, of significant others and of physical and sociocultural environment have been suggested as supporting a pre-reflective sense of self-continuity. Stark biographical discontinuities or disruptions in these areas may destabilise the sense of self-continuity. To test the hypothesis that autobiographical reasoning in life narratives helps to compensate the effects of biographical discontinuities on the sense of self-continuity, life narratives of a lifespan sample with the ages of 16, 20, 24, 28, 44 and 69 (N = 150, 78 female) were investigated. Results confirm that if, and only if there have been biographical disruptions in the past four years, then autobiographical reasoning correlates positively with a sense of self-continuity.

In a sample of n = 1,158 college women (mean age = 18.04, 95% of participants were 18 at Time 1), we found support for these hypotheses. Negative urgency, measured prior to college entry, predicted the onset of NSSI behavior across the first year of college (odds ratio = 1.58). Lack of perseverance predicted the maintenance of NSSI status across the first year of college, controlling for prior NSSI behavior (odds ratio = 1.73).

A three-group model claimed by Hodgins proposes distinguishing between people who start offending before the onset of psychosis (early starters), after psychosis onset but at age 34years or under (late starters) and after psychosis onset but at age 35years or older (late first offenders). AimsThis study aimed to test the hypotheses (1) that the personality of early starters and non-psychotic offenders would be similar, but different from either late-starter group; (2) that the late-starter groups would be more likely to have positive psychotic symptoms than non-criminal patients with schizophrenia; and (3) that symptom types would differentiate the psychotic groups. MethodsA retrospective file study was conducted on cases of 97 early starters, 100 late starters and 26 late first offenders all drawn from the Netherlands Institute of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology (NIFP) archives 1993-2008, 115 non-psychotic offenders from 2005-2008 NIFP archives and 129 patients with schizophrenia and no criminal history from one general service in Rotterdam. ResultsEarly starters closely resembled the non-psychotic offenders in their premorbid anti-social personality characteristics. The two late-onset offending psychosis groups were more likely to have persecutory and/or grandiose delusions than non-offenders with psychosis, but so were the early starters. ImplicationsIn a first study to compare subgroups of offenders with psychosis directly with non-psychotic offenders and non-offenders with psychosis, we found such additional support for a distinction between early and late starters with psychosis that different treatment strategies would seem indicated, focusing on personality and substance misuse for the former but psychotic symptoms for all. It remains to be seen whether the higher rate of alcohol misuse amongst late first offenders is a fundamental distinction or a function of age difference.

We used the 2000 and the 2007 British Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys to test the hypothesis that bullying is associated with individual psychotic phenomena and with psychosis, and predicts the later emergence of persecutory ideation and hallucinations. Methods We analysed two nationally representative surveys of individuals aged 16 years or older in Great Britain (2000) and England (2007). Respondents were presented with a card listing stressful events to identify experiences of bullying over the entire lifespan. We assessed associations with the dependent variables persecutory ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations, and diagnosis of probable psychosis. All analyses were controlled for sociodemographic confounders, intelligence quotient (IQ), and other traumas. Findings We used data for 8580 respondents from 2000 and 7403 from 2007. Bullying was associated with presence of persecutory ideation and hallucinations, remaining so after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, IQ, other traumas, and childhood sexual abuse. Bullying was associated with a diagnosis of probable psychosis. If reported at baseline, bullying predicted emergence and maintenance of persecutory ideation and hallucinations during 18 months of follow-up in the 2000 survey. Controlling for other traumas and childhood sexual abuse did not affect the association between bullying and psychotic symptoms, but reduced the significance of the association with diagnosis of probable psychosis. Bullying was most strongly associated with the presence of concurrent persecutory ideation and hallucinations. Interpretation Bullying victimisation increases the risk of individual psychotic symptoms and of a diagnosis of probable psychosis. Early detection of bullying and use of treatments oriented towards its psychological consequences might ameliorate the course of psychosis.","2015-07","2018-12-21 18:00:03","2018-12-21 18:00:03","","618-624","","7","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Participants were 529 older people without cognitive impairment at study onset. They completed annual evaluations that included assessment of negative social interactions (e.g., unsympathetic behavior, rejection), cognitive testing, and clinical classification of mild cognitive impairment. Results: During a mean of 4.8 years of follow-up (SD = 2.5), 198 individuals (37.4%) developed mild cognitive impairment. In a proportional hazards model, higher baseline frequency of negative social interactions (M = 1.51, SD = 0.43, skewness = 1.60) was associated with higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio = 1.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.13, 2.07). Results were similar after adjustment for depressive symptoms, social network size, social activity, and loneliness. This association was mainly due to neglect and rejection. There was no change in negative social interaction rate over time (estimate = -0.003, SE = 0.004, p = .508). Higher baseline level of negative social interaction was associated with lower initial level of global cognition (estimate = -0.096, SE = 0.034, p = .005) but not with cognitive decline (estimate = -0.018, SE = 0.011, p = .098).

However, non-Western studies on birth order and sibling sex ratio in androphilic males (transsexual or non-transsexual) are rare. The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that androphilic male-to-female transsexuals have a late birth order and a relative excess of brothers in a non-Western culture with a higher fertility rate. The participants were 60 androphilic male-to-female transsexuals and 61 male heterosexual controls. The transsexual participants had significantly more older brothers than the control participants, but the groups did not differ in their numbers of older sisters, younger brothers, or younger sisters. The foregoing pattern is usually referred to as the “fraternal birth order effect.” Slater's and Berglin's Indexes both showed that the mean birth order of the control participants was very close to that expected from a random sample drawn from a demographically stable population whereas the mean birth order of the transsexual participants was later. A measure of sibship composition, brothers/all siblings, showed that the transsexual group had a higher proportion of male siblings compared with the control group. In conclusion, the present study found that Turkish androphilic male-to-female transsexuals show the same high fraternal birth order that has been found in comparable androphilic samples in Western Europe, North America, and the South Pacific, which suggests a common underlying biological causal mechanism.","2015-07","2018-12-21 18:00:05","2018-12-21 18:00:05","","1331-1337","","5","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Androphilia; Birth order; Cross-cultural; Gender identity disorder; Sibling sex ratio; Transsexualism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the former, observers report whether presentation of two stimuli was subjectively simultaneous; in the latter, they report which stimulus was subjectively presented first. SJ and TOJ tasks typically give discrepant results, which has prompted the view that performance is mediated by different processes in each task. We looked at these discrepancies from a model that yields psychometric functions whose parameters characterize the timing, decisional, and response processes involved in SJ and TOJ tasks. We analyzed 12 data sets from published studies in which both tasks had been used in within-subjects designs, all of which had reported differences in performance across tasks. Fitting the model jointly to data from both tasks, we tested the hypothesis that common timing processes sustain simultaneity and temporal-order judgments, with differences in performance arising from task-dependent decisional and response processes. The results supported this hypothesis, also showing that model psychometric functions account for aspects of SJ and TOJ data that classical analyses overlook.

Methods: This was an 8-day diary of 173 family caregivers of individuals with dementia. Multilevel models with common within-person variance were fit first to show average associations between daily stressors and mean level of daily affect. Then multilevel models with heterogeneous within-person variance were fit to test the hypotheses on associations between ADS use, daily experiences, and intrinsic fluctuation in daily affect. Results: The study showed that, when the sum of ADS days was greater than average, there was a stabilizing effect of ADS use on caregivers' within-person fluctuation in negative affect. Moreover, fewer daily stressors and greater-than-average daily care-related stressors, more positive events, not being a spouse, greater-than-average duration of caregiving, and less-than-average dependency of individuals with dementia on activities of daily living were associated with less fluctuation. Better sleep quality was associated with less intrinsic fluctuation in anger; and younger age and more years of education were associated with less intrinsic fluctuation in daily depression. Conclusions: Because emotional stability has been argued as an aspect of emotional well-being in the general populations, intrinsic fluctuation of emotional experience was suggested as an outcome of evidence-based interventions for family caregivers.","2015-07","2018-12-21 18:00:07","2018-12-21 18:00:07","","729-740","","7","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adult day service (ADS); daily negative affect; daily stressors; intrinsic fluctuation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 4 studies, we test the hypothesis that individuals with greater cardiac vagal flexibility, operationalized as higher cardiac vagal tone at rest and greater cardiac vagal withdrawal (indexed by a decrease in respiratory sinus arrhythmia) during cognitive or attentional demand, perceive social-emotional information more accurately and show greater sensitivity to their social context. Study 1 sets the foundation for this investigation by establishing that vagal flexibility can be elicited consistently in the laboratory and reliably over time. Study 2 demonstrates that vagal flexibility has different associations with psychological characteristics than does vagal tone, and that these characteristics are primarily social in nature. Study 3 links individual differences in vagal flexibility with accurate detection of social and emotional cues depicted in still facial images. Study 4 demonstrates that individuals with greater vagal flexibility respond to dynamic social feedback in a more context-sensitive manner than do individuals with less vagal flexibility. Specifically, compared with their less flexible counterparts, individuals with greater vagal flexibility, when assigned to receive negative social feedback, report more shame, show more pronounced blood pressure responses, and display less sociable behavior, but when receiving positive social feedback display more sociable behavior. Taken together, these findings suggest that vagal flexibility is a useful individual difference physiological predictor of social sensitivity, which may have implications for clinical, developmental, and health psychologists.","2015-07","2018-12-21 18:00:07","2018-12-21 18:00:07","","106-120","","1","109","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cardiac vagal reactivity; social sensitivity; vagal flexibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The measurement of social axioms follows the approach of Leung et al., whereas individual values focus on Hagan et al.'s second-order concept of hierarchic self-interest.

Acting prosocially is one such source of value, and previous research suggests that reminders of mortality increase the desire for prosociality. In three studies, we tested the hypothesis that mortality reminders would lead to more generous allocation of financial resources and to more satisfaction derived from acting generously. Using the dictator game (Study 1), the ultimatum game (Study 2), and a quasi-naturalistic giving situation (Study 3) we showed that participants reminded of their mortality were not only more generous but also more satisfied the more money they donated. Moreover, Study 3 demonstrated that people reminded of their mortality derived higher satisfaction from prosocial behavior and such behavior was associated with better suppression of death-related thoughts. We conclude that acting prosocially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety and in turn produces psychological satisfaction. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The first aim was to use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test a hypothesis that two factors (internalizing and externalizing) account for lifetime co-morbid DSM-IV diagnoses among adults with bipolar I (BPI) disorder. The second aim was to use confirmatory latent class analysis (CLCA) to test the hypothesis that four clinical subtypes are detectible: pure BPI; BPI plus internalizing disorders only; BPI plus externalizing disorders only; and BPI plus internalizing and externalizing disorders. Method. A cohort of 699 multiplex BPI families was studied, ascertained and assessed (1998-2003) by the National Institute of Mental Health Genetics Initiative Bipolar Consortium: 1156 with BPI disorder (504 adult probands; 594 first-degree relatives; and 58 more distant relatives) and 563 first-degree relatives without BPI. Best-estimate consensus DSM-IV diagnoses were based on structured interviews, family history and medical records. MPLUS software was used for CFA and CLCA. Results. The two-factor CFA model fit the data very well, and could not be improved by adding or removing paths. The four-class CLCA model fit better than exploratory LCA models or post-hoc-modified CLCA models. The two factors and four classes were associated with distinctive clinical course and severity variables, adjusted for proband gender. Comorbidity, especially more than one internalizing and/or externalizing disorder, was associated with a more severe and complicated course of illness. The four classes demonstrated significant familial aggregation, adjusted for gender and age of relatives. Conclusions. The BPI two-factor and four-cluster hypotheses demonstrated substantial confirmatory support. These models may be useful for subtyping BPI disorders, predicting course of illness and refining the phenotype in genetic studies.","2015-07","2018-12-21 18:00:11","2018-12-21 18:00:11","","2181-2196","","10","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bipolar disorder; co-morbidity; confirmatory factor analysis; confirmatory latent class analysis; subtypes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a sample of managers, a group for whom empathic accuracy is a valuable skill, empathic accuracy was lower for managers who possessed structural power and also for managers who endorsed social dominance, regardless of their structural power. Moreover, men were less empathically accurate than women, a relationship that may be explained by men's higher SDO and greater structural power.

Results: In patients with schizophrenia, we observed increased amplitude of low frequency fluctuations but normal hippocampal connectivity using independent component and seed-based analyses.

We investigated the development of emotion recognition abilities through childhood and adolescence, testing the hypothesis that children's ability to recognize simple emotions is modulated by chronological age, pubertal stage and gender. In order to establish norms, we assessed 478 children aged 6-16 years, using the Ekman-Friesen Pictures of Facial Affect. We then modeled these cross-sectional data in terms of competence in accurate recognition of the six emotions studied, when the positive correlation between emotion recognition and IQ was controlled. Significant linear trends were seen in children's ability to recognize facial expressions of happiness, surprise, fear, and disgust; there was improvement with increasing age. In contrast, for sad and angry expressions there is little or no change in accuracy over the age range 6-16 years; nearadult levels of competence are established by middle-childhood. In a sampled subset, pubertal status influenced the ability to recognize facial expressions of disgust and anger; there was an increase in competence from mid to late puberty, which occurred independently of age. A small female advantage was found in the recognition of some facial expressions. The normative data provided in this study will aid clinicians and researchers in assessing the emotion recognition abilities of children and will facilitate the identification of abnormalities in a skill that is often impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders. If emotion recognition abilities are a good model with which to understand adolescent development, then these results could have implications for the education, mental health provision and legal treatment of teenagers.","2015-06-16","2018-12-21 18:00:14","2018-12-21 18:00:14","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","child development; emotion; emotion recognition; face recognition; facial expression; social cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sample of 741 Hispanic adolescents (M age = 13.9, SD = .67) and their caregivers were recruited from 18 participating middle schools in Miami-Dade County, FL. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized ecodevelopmental model of early substance use, accounting for school clustering effects. Results provided strong support for the model (CFI = .95; RMSEA = .03). School SES was indirectly related to the likelihood of starting substance use through perceived peer use norms (beta = .03, p < .02). Similarly, school climate had an indirect effect on substance use initiation through family functioning and perceptions of peer use norms (beta = -.03,p < .01). Neither school ethnic composition nor school acculturation had indirect effects on initiation of substance use. Results highlight the importance of the interplay of risk and protective factors at multiple ecological levels that impact early substance use initiation. Further, findings underscore the key role of school level characteristics on the initiation of substance use and present opportunities for intervention.

The current treatment of elders' chronic pain suffers from many limits, and this article addresses this issue by discussing a new and innovative non-pharmacological intervention (mindfulness therapy) to reduce consequences of chronic pain in daily-life. Mindfulness therapy mainly targets two transdiagnostic mental processes - avoidance and self-centered ruminations - which leads to emotional dysregulation in chronic pain patients. Although many studies documented the beneficial effect of mindfulness therapy on psychological symptoms in adults, there is still a lack of studies testing the effect of mindfulness therapy on emotional regulation and psychological symptoms in elderly population with chronic pain. It is therefore necessary to investigate therapeutic efficacy with this population. In conclusion, we formulate several lines of research to test the hypothesis that the effect of the mindfulness therapy on targeted processes would improve elders' ability to cope with chronic pain and would reduce disturbances associated with chronic pain.","2015-06","2018-12-21 18:00:18","2018-12-21 18:00:18","","147-156","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","French","","","","","","","","","","","chronic pain; elderly; mindfulness; targeted processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although dysregulated striatal-cortical network interactions have been identified in cocaine addiction, the association between these brain networks and addiction is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES To test the hypothesis that cocaine addiction is associated with disturbances in striatal-cortical communication as captured by resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), measured from coherent spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signal, and to explore the relationships between striatal rsFC, trait impulsivity, and uncontrolled drug use in cocaine addiction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A case-control, cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program outpatient magnetic resonance imaging facility. Data used in the present study were collected between December 8, 2005, and September 30, 2011. Participants included 56 non-treatment-seeking cocaine users (CUs) (52 with cocaine dependence and 3 with cocaine abuse) and 56 healthy individuals serving as controls (HCs) matched on age, sex, years of education, race, estimated intelligence, and smoking status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Voxelwise statistical parametric analysis testing the rsFC strength differences between CUs and HCs in brain regions functionally connected to 6 striatal subregions defined a priori. RESULTS Increased rsFC strength was observed predominantly in striatal-frontal circuits; decreased rsFC was found between the striatum and cingulate, striatal, temporal, hippocampal/amygdalar, and insular regions in the CU group compared with the HCs. Increased striatal-dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex connectivity strength was positively correlated with the amount of recent cocaine use (uncorrected P < .046) and elevated trait impulsivity in the CUs (uncorrected P < .012), and an index reflecting the balance between striatal-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and striatal-anterior prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex circuits was significantly associated with loss of control over cocaine use (corrected P < .012). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cocaine addiction is associated with disturbed rsFC in several specific striatal-cortical circuits. Specifically, compulsive cocaine use, a defining characteristic of dependence, was associated with a balance of increased striatal-anterior prefrontal/orbitofrontal and decreased striatal-dorsal anterior cingulate connectivity; trait impulsivity, both a risk factor for and a consequence of cocaine use, was associated with increased dorsal striatal-dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex connectivity uniquely in CUs. These findings provide new insights toward the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction and suggest potential novel therapeutic targets for treatment.","2015-06","2018-12-21 18:00:20","2018-12-21 18:00:20","","584-592","","6","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present analyses of pooled data from four separate studies (all n > 169; total n = 821) that assessed differential aspects of disability and their potential determinants. We hypothesized that negative symptoms would predict social outcomes, but not vocational functioning or everyday activities and that cognition and functional capacity would predict vocational functioning and everyday activities but not social outcomes. The samples were rated by clinician informants for their everyday functioning in domains of social and vocational outcomes, and everyday activities, examined with assessments of cognition and functional capacity, rated clinically with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and self-reporting depression. We computed a model that tested the hypotheses described above and compared it to a model that predicted that negative symptoms, depression, cognition, and functional capacity had equivalent influences on all aspects of everyday functioning. The former, specific relationship model fit the data adequately and we subsequently confirmed a similar fit within all four samples. Analyses of the relative goodness of fit suggested that this specific model fit the data better than the more general, equivalent influence predictor model. We suggest that treatments aimed at cognition may not affect social functioning as much as other aspects of disability, a finding consistent with earlier research on the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, while negative symptoms predicted social functioning. These relationships are central features of schizophrenia and treatment efforts should be aimed accordingly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study also tested for a moderating effect of NSSI in the relationship between suicide ideation (SI) and SA. Method: A large number of Chinese adolescents participated in this study (the exact number of participants varied from 3,623 to 6,911 in different analyses). They completed questionnaires assessing NSSI, SA, SI, borderline personality disorder features, depressive symptoms, and self-criticism 3 times at 6-month intervals. Generalized estimating equations were used to test the hypotheses. Results: In females, but not in males, NSSI was significantly associated with future SA after controlling for the effects of shared risk factors. With the same frequency of SI, the frequency of NSSI also enhanced the risk for future SA. Conclusions: This study established a longitudinal association between NSSI and SA, which could not be fully accounted for by their shared risk factors, in Chinese female community adolescents. Moreover, female adolescents who frequently engage in NSSI may gain the capability for attempting suicide.","2015-06","2018-12-21 18:00:22","2018-12-21 18:00:22","","524-533","","3","83","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; longitudinal association; nonsuicidal self-injury; suicide attempt; suicide ideation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One compound that has generated interest in this regard is oxytocin (OT), a mammalian neuropeptide that modulates activity of the neurocircuit mediating fear extinction and memory processes. Recent research in healthy humans has suggested that intranasal OT administered prior to fear extinction training enhances fear extinction performance, supporting its potential to augment exposure-based psychotherapy. Here, we tested the hypothesis that OT treatment would facilitate response to exposure therapy in patients with specific phobia. MethodsWe conducted a small proof-of-concept trial investigating the effect of pretreatment intranasal OT administration on a brief, single-session exposure treatment for arachnophobia (fear of spiders). The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled (n = 13 placebo, 11 females; n = 10 OT, 8 females) with 1-week and 1-month follow-up assessments. Dependent measures attended to arachnophobia symptoms (self-report), phobic behavior (behavioral avoidance of spider task), and treatment credibility/therapeutic alliance. ResultsAdministration of OT prior to exposure therapy tended to impede treatment response as measured by self-report of symptoms at both follow-up periods. OT treatment did not significantly affect behavioral measures of fear. Immediately after OT administration but before therapy, the OT group trended toward less confidence in the treatment. The OT group also trended toward lower ratings of therapeutic alliance than placebo. ConclusionsThese results suggest that OT administration effects on extinction may vary depending on conditions and population.","2015-06","2018-12-21 18:00:22","2018-12-21 18:00:22","","400-407","","6","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anxiety; anxiety disorders; CBT; clinical trials; cognitive behavior therapy; pharmacotherapy; phobia; phobic disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a representative national sample (Study 1), dispositional tendencies to experience awe predicted greater generosity in an economic game above and beyond other prosocial emotions (e.g., compassion). In follow-up experiments, inductions of awe (relative to various control states) increased ethical decision-making (Study 2), generosity (Study 3), and prosocial values (Study 4). Finally, a naturalistic induction of awe in which participants stood in a grove of towering trees enhanced prosocial helping behavior and decreased entitlement compared to participants in a control condition (Study 5).

We applied a socioecological approach to test the hypotheses that the experience of poverty is associated with decreased feelings of safety at school, and that residential neighborhood features partly mediate the relationship between poverty and feeling less safe at school. This study draws on the Qu,bec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD) which began in 1998 with a representative population-based cohort of 2,120 5-month old infants (49.1 % female) and their primary caregiver. The study also includes measures of ego-centred residential neighborhood exposures (based on a 500 m circular buffer zone surrounding the family's residential postal code) derived from a spatial data infrastructure. We used latent growth modeling to estimate youth's family poverty trajectory from age 5 months to 13 years, and structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. The results suggest that youth experiencing chronic and later-childhood poverty felt less safe at school in part because they lived in neighborhoods that their parents described as being disorderly (e.g., demarked by the presence of garbage, drug use and groups of trouble-makers). These neighborhoods also tended to have less greenery (e.g., trees, parks) and more lone-parent households. Neighborhood features did not help explain the relationship between early-childhood poverty and feeling less safe at school. The findings suggest that targeting residential neighborhood features such as greenery and disorder could improve youth's felt safety at school, particularly for those experiencing chronic and later-childhood poverty.","2015-06","2018-12-21 18:00:25","2018-12-21 18:00:25","","1194-1207","","6, SI","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Neighborhood; Poverty trajectory; Residential; Safety; School; Youth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder (BD) have overlapping clinical presentations and symptoms - sources of persistent clinical confusion. Game-theory can characterize how social function might be sub-optimal in the two disorders and move the field beyond the anecdotal description of clinical history. Here, we tested the hypothesis that BPD and BD can be distinguished on the basis of diminished reciprocal altruism in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) games. Method. Twenty females with BPD, 20 females with euthymic BD and 20 healthy (non-clinical) females, matched for age and cognitive ability, were assessed for Axis-I and personality disorders, and completed psychometric measures of state affect, impulsivity and hostility. Participants completed two iterated PD games and a test of gaze-cueing. Results. In the PD games, BPD participants failed to show statistically stable preferences to cooperate with social partners (playing tit-for-tat) and made significantly fewer cooperative responses compared to BD or controls (ANOVA main effect p = 0.03, post-hoc Tukey p < 0.05 for both comparisons). BPD participants were also less likely to sustain cooperation following experiences involving mutual cooperation than the other groups. Neither BPD nor BD participants demonstrated impairments in shifting visual attention on the basis of other peoples' gaze. Conclusions. These data indicate that BPD is (selectively) associated with difficulties in establishing, and then maintaining, reciprocal cooperation, involving altruism. These difficulties are not seen in euthymic BD. Our data support the differentiation of BPD from BD and offer fresh insights into the social difficulties experienced by individuals with diagnoses of BPD.","2015-06","2018-12-21 18:00:26","2018-12-21 18:00:26","","1591-1600","","8","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bipolar disorder; borderline personality disorder; cooperation; game-theory; Prisoner's Dilemma; reciprocal altruism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several studies have reported good effects for patients with personality disorders (PD) in diverse forms of psychotherapy, the significance of treatment duration is unclear. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that PD patients would improve more during and after LTG than STG. DesignA randomized, longitudinal, prospective study contrasting the outcomes during and after short- and long-term dynamic group psychotherapies. MethodsOne hundred and sixty-seven outpatients with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or PD were randomized to STG or LTG (respectively, 20 or 80 weekly sessions of 90min each). Outcome measures are as follows: symptoms (SCL-90-R), interpersonal problems (IIP-C), and psychosocial functioning (GAF split version: GAF-Symptom and GAF-Function). PD pathology (number of PD criteria items) was selected a priori as a putative moderator of treatment effects. Change during the 3-year study period was assessed using linear mixed models. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT 00021417. ResultsOur hypothesis was supported, as patients with PD improved significantly more regarding all outcome variables in LTG than STG.

ConclusionsThe effectiveness of LTG is higher for patients with co-morbid PD.

We test the hypothesis that pregnancy quitters have higher maternal-fetal attachment than persistent smokers, and secondarily explore how maternal-fetal attachment differs among non-smokers, pregnancy quitters, and persistent smokers. Methods: Participants were 156 women in the Behavior and Mood in Babies and Mothers study who provided report of smoking throughout pregnancy via timeline follow back interviews, with salivary cotinine confirmation of reported cessation at 30 and 35 week gestation, and postpartum day one. Maternal Fetal Attachment Scale total and subscale scores (role-taking, differentiation of self from fetus, interaction with fetus, attributing characteristics to fetus, giving of self) were examined among non-smokers, pregnancy quitters, and persistent smokers. Results: At 30 weeks, pregnancy quitters scored higher on the `giving of self subscale compared to persistent smokers (21.6 +/- 2.4 versus 19.9 +/- 2.9; p = .004). Maternal `giving of self' also differentiated pregnancies exposed to cigarette smoking from those without exposure from 30 weeks through delivery (19.9 2.9 versus 212 +/- 2.2; p = .002).

Relative to their frequent early exposure to violence and maltreatment, these mothers display dysregulation of their hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA-axis), characterized by hypocortisolism. Considering methylation of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 as a marker for HPA-axis functioning, with less methylation likely being associated with less circulating cortisol, the present study tested the hypothesis that the degree of methylation of this gene would be negatively correlated with maternal IPV-PTSD severity and parenting stress, and positively correlated with medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) activity in response to video-stimuli of stressful versus non-stressful mother child interactions. Following a mental health assessment, 45 mothers and their children (ages 12-42 months) participated in a behavioral protocol involving free-play and laboratory stressors such as mother child separation. Maternal DNA was extracted from saliva. Interactive behavior was rated on the CARE-Index. During subsequent fMRI scanning, mothers were shown films of free-play and separation drawn from this protocol. Maternal PTSD severity and parenting stress were negatively correlated with the mean percentage of methylation of NR3C1. Maternal mPFC activity in response to video-stimuli of mother child separation versus play correlated positively to NR3C1 methylation, and negatively to maternal IPV-PTSD and parenting stress. Among interactive behavior variables, child cooperativeness in play was positively correlated with NR3C1 methylation.

We propose that it is the perceived agency of ingroups that provides the self with a sense of control. In three experiments, we for the first time tested the hypothesis that threat to personal control increases the attractiveness of being part or joining those groups that are perceived as coherent entities engaging in coordinated group goal pursuit (agentic groups) but not of those groups whose agency is perceived to be low. Consistent with this hypothesis we found in Study 1 (N = 93) that threat to personal control increased ingroup identification only with task groups, but not with less agentic types of ingroups that were made salient simultaneously. Furthermore, personal control threat increased a sense of collective control and support within the task group, mediated through task-group identification (indirect effects). Turning to groups people are not (yet) part of, Study 2 (N = 47) showed that personal control threat increased relative attractiveness ratings of small groups as possible future ingroups only when the relative agency of small groups was perceived to be high. Perceived group homogeneity or social power did not moderate the effect. Study 3 (N = 78) replicated the moderating role of perceived group agency for attractiveness ratings of entitative groups, whereas perceived group status did not moderate the effect. These findings extend previous research on group-based control, showing that perceived agency accounts for group-based responses to threatened control.","2015-05-27","2018-12-21 18:00:32","2018-12-21 18:00:32","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agency; control motivation; group processes; responses to threat; social identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical evidence from case reports indicate that this effect may occur early on at the beginning of lithium treatment. The impact of lithium treatment on acute suicidal thoughts and/or behavior has not been systematically studied in a controlled trial. The primary objective of this confirmatory study is to determine the association between lithium therapy and acute suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior in inpatients with a major depressive episode (MDE, unipolar and bipolar disorder according to DSM IV criteria). The specific aim is to test the hypothesis that lithium plus treatment as usual (TAU), compared to placebo plus TAU, results in a significantly greater decrease in suicidal ideation and/or behavior over 5 weeks in inpatients with MDE. Methods/Design: We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Patients with the diagnosis of a moderate to severe depressive episode and suicidal thoughts and/or suicidal behavior measured with the Sheehan-Suicidality-Tracking Scale (S-STS) will be randomly allocated to add lithium or placebo to their treatment as usual. Change in the clinician administered S-STS from the initial to the final visit will be the primary outcome.

Here, we test the convergent effects of methyl-CpG binding domain 5 (MBD5) and special AT-rich binding protein 2 (SATB2) reduced dosage in human neural stem cells (NSCs), two genes implicated in 2q23.1 and 2q33.1 deletion syndromes, respectively, to develop a generalized model for NDDs. We used short hairpin RNA stably incorporated into healthy neural stem cells to supress MBD5 and SATB2 expression, and massively parallel RNA sequencing, DNA methylation sequencing and microRNA arrays to test the hypothesis that a primary etiology of NDDs is the disruption of the balance of NSC proliferation and differentiation. We show that reduced dosage of either gene leads to significant overlap of gene-expression patterns, microRNA patterns and DNA methylation states with control NSCs in a differentiating state, suggesting that a unifying feature of 2q23.1 and 2q33.1 deletion syndrome may be a lack of regulation between proliferation and differentiation in NSCs, as we observed previously for TCF4 and EHMT1 suppression following a similar experimental paradigm. We propose a model of NDDs whereby the balance of NSC proliferation and differentiation is affected, but where the molecules that drive this effect are largely specific to disease-causing genetic variation. NDDs are diverse, complex and unique, but the optimal balance of factors that determine when and where neural stem cells differentiate may be a major feature underlying the diverse phenotypic spectrum of NDDs.","2015-05-12","2018-12-21 18:00:33","2018-12-21 18:00:33","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tested whether quantity of social support seeking indirectly reduced distress severity among student survivors of mass university shootings. Hypotheses specified that the indirect effects of social support seeking on distress severity would occur through positively influencing perceived social support and self-efficacy, and that these effects would emerge and become stronger as posttraumatic stress symptom severity increased.

Analysis found five latent constructs best fitted the data: medication attitudes, self-esteem, accepting need for treatment, self-rated insight, and objective insight. All were related and each affected the others as it changed, except self-esteem and medication attitudes. Low self-reported insight at presentation predicted readmission.

In this cohort study we modeled the effect of clozapine on mortality over a 5-year period (2007-2011) using Cox regression. Individuals prescribed clozapine had more severe psychopathology and poorer functional status. Many of the exposures associated with clozapine use were themselves risk factors for increased mortality. However, we identified a strong association between being prescribed clozapine and lower mortality which persisted after controlling for a broad range of potential confounders including clinical monitoring and markers of disease severity (adjusted hazard ratio 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-0.7; p = .001). This association remained after restricting the sample to those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or those taking antipsychotics and after using propensity scores to reduce the impact of confounding by indication. Among individuals with SMI, those prescribed clozapine had a reduced risk of mortality due to both natural and unnatural causes. We found no evidence to indicate that lower mortality associated with clozapine in SMI was due to increased clinical monitoring or confounding factors. This is the first study to report an association between clozapine and reduced risk of mortality from natural causes.","2015-05","2018-12-21 18:00:35","2018-12-21 18:00:35","","644-655","","3","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar affective disorder; clinician contact; clozapine; mortality; schizoaffective disorder; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, people vary in the extent to which interoceptive signals reach awareness. This trait modulates both their experience of emotion and their ability to distinguish `self' from `other' in multisensory contexts. The experience of emotion and the degree of self/other distinction or overlap are similarly fundamental to empathy, which is an umbrella term comprising affect sharing, empathic concern and perspective-taking (PT). A link has therefore often been assumed between interoceptive awareness (IA) and empathy despite a lack of clear evidence. To test the hypothesis that individual differences in both traits should correlate, we measured IA in four experiments, using a well-validated heartbeat perception task, and compared this with scores on several tests that relate to various aspects of empathy. We firstly measured scores on the Index of Interpersonal Reactivity and secondly on the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy. Thirdly, because the `simulationist' account assumes that affect sharing is involved in recognizing emotion, we employed the `Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task' for the recognition of facial expressions. Contrary to expectation, we found no significant relationships between IA and any aspect of these measures. This striking lack of direct links has important consequences for hypotheses about the extent to which empathy is necessarily embodied. Finally, to assess cognitive PT ability, which specifically requires self/other distinction, we used the `Director Task' but found no relationship. We conclude that the abilities that make up empathy are potentially related to IA in a variety of conflicting ways, such that a direct association between IA and various components of empathy has yet to be established.","2015-05-01","2018-12-21 18:00:35","2018-12-21 18:00:35","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","emotion recognition; empathy; heartbeat perception; interoception; perspective-taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The transactional model tests the hypothesis that parent involvement and child adjustment are reciprocally related over time. These models are tested with a large sample of low-income, racially/ethnically diverse children and their parents who were assessed in the fall and spring of children's 3rd and 4th grades. Overall, consistent support for the child adjustment hypothesis was found. When children were struggling academically, socially, and behaviorally, their parents showed higher prospective levels of homework assistance and home-school conferencing but lower levels of school-based support.

Deep structures were complementary: major features of the learning content in one experiment became minor features in the other experiment, and vice versa. Text was held constant.

Furthermore, they were either instructed to process the material from the perspective supported by the graphic or from an alternative perspective, or they received no further instruction. After learning, they were asked to recall the learning content from different perspectives by completing graphs of different formats as accurately as possible. Learners' recall was more accurate if the format of recall was the same as the learning format which indicates surface structure influences. However, participants also showed more accurate recall when they remembered the content from a perspective emphasizing the deep structure, regardless of the graphics format presented before.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the retinal microvessels reflect familial vulnerability to psychotic symptoms. Participants were 531 adolescent and young adult twins who took part in the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study and the Twins Eye Study in Tasmania. The twins had photographs taken of their retina when they were adolescents or young adults (M age = 20.6 years), and retinal vessel diameter was assessed using computer software. The twins completed an assessment of psychosis symptoms approximately six years later. We compared retinal venular diameters of individuals with one or more symptoms of psychosis (n = 45), their unaffected co-twins (n = 24), and controls (n = 462). Individuals with one or more symptoms of psychosis had wider venules (standardized mean = 0.29) than controls (standardized mean = -0.04; p = .03), and unaffected co-twins had venular diameters that were intermediate (standardized mean = 0.13) between the two groups, suggesting that wide venules may represent a proxy marker of familial vulnerability to psychosis symptoms. Consistent with previous work, there were no differences in arteriolar diameter between individuals with and without symptoms of psychosis. Findings suggest that wide retinal venules may serve as a proxy marker of familial liability to psychosis symptoms. The pathophysiological mechanisms linking psychosis and cardiovascular disease may be operative from early in life, possibly at the level of the microvasculature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Data from genetic scans in humans suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophic factor family, may be associated with substance abuse or dependence. To test the hypothesis that the BDNF gene polymorphism is involved in methamphetamine abuse, we compared three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs16917204, rs16917234, and rs2030324) of the BDNF gene in 200 methamphetamine abusers and 219 healthy individuals. We also considered the association of these polymorphisms with impulsivity in methamphetamine abusers using Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11(BIS-11) Chinese version. Individual SNP analysis showed no significant differences in genotype and allele distributions between the methamphetamine abusers and controls. Haplotype analysis of rs16917204 rs16917234-rs2030324 revealed that a major C-C-T haplotype was significantly associated a lower odds of methamphetamine abuse, even after Bonferroni correction. Within the methamphetamine-abuse group, subjects carrying the T allele of rs2030324 genotype had significantly higher motor impulsivity scores of BIS compared to those with the C/C genotype. Our findings suggest that the BDNF gene polymorphism may contribute to the impulsivity in methamphetamine abusers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The model suggests that economic and neighborhood stressors influence youth adjustment via disruptions to parenting. Incorporating integrative developmental theory, we examined the degree to which parents' cultural value orientations mitigated the effects of stressors on parenting disruptions and the degree to which environmental adversity qualified the effect of parenting on adolescent adjustment. We tested the hypothesized integrative family stress model longitudinally in a sample of mother-youth dyads (N = 749) and father-youth dyads (N = 467) from Mexican origin families, across 3 times points spanning early to middle adolescence. Providing the first longitudinal evidence of family stress mediated effects, mothers' perceptions of economic pressure were associated with increases in adolescent externalizing symptoms 5 years later via intermediate increases in harsh parenting. The remaining findings supported the notion that integrative developmental theory can inform family stress model hypothesis testing that is culturally and contextually relevant for a wide range of diverse families and youth. For example, fathers' perceptions of economic pressure and neighborhood danger had important implications for adolescent internalizing, via reductions in paternal warmth, but only at certain levels of neighborhood adversity. Mothers' familism value orientations mitigated the effects of economic pressure on maternal warmth, protecting their adolescents from experiencing developmental costs associated with environmental stressors. Results are discussed in terms of identifying how integrative developmental theory intersects with the family stress model to set diverse youth on different developmental pathways.","2015-05","2018-12-21 18:00:39","2018-12-21 18:00:39","","649-662","","5","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","culture; fathers; Latino; neighborhoods; socioeconomic status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifty children (23 with ADHD, 27 typically developing) performed an instrumental learning task in which they had to map four stimuli to two responses using feedback that differed in information value and that was coupled to monetary gain (a,not sign0.2). Feedback was either contingent, thus fully informative on performance, or probabilistic, and informative in only 88 % of the trials. Dependent variables were response accuracy and latency. Contrary to predictions, children with ADHD and typically developing controls did not differ in their ability to acquire the stimulus-response mappings, in either condition. This indicates that with a simple instrumental learning task, children with ADHD are able to learn from rewarded feedback, as controls do, suggesting that children with ADHD are capable of learning both at home and in class when the environment is adequate. Possibly, learning problems are more evident in children with comorbid ODD, as exploratory analyses indicated that accuracy scores were significantly reduced when children with ADHD exhibited high levels of parent-rated ODD symptoms. Medication analysis showed that children with ADHD completed the task more accurately and faster when taking MPH compared to placebo, particularly when the dose was high.","2015-05","2018-12-21 18:00:40","2018-12-21 18:00:40","","681-691","","4","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ADHD; Feedback; Learning; Methylphenidate; ODD; Reward","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cognitive match on treatment goals has been shown to relate to the quality of the relationship (or alliance) between a therapist and the person receiving intervention, which in turn predicts the effectiveness of interventions. However, in multicultural societies therapists and patients do not always share the same ethnic background, which could influence their match on treatment goals. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that there is a cognitive match regarding the importance of sensitivity in early childhood parenting across Dutch and Moroccan, Turkish, Surinamese, and Antillean ethnic minority mothers and youthmental health professionals in the Netherlands and Turkish mothers and youth mental health professionals in Turkey. A total of 105 mothers with at least one child between the ages of 6 months and 6 years and 98 female professionals described their views about the ideal sensitive mother using the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (Pederson et al. inManual maternal behavior Q-sort version 3.1, 1999). Both professionals' and mothers' beliefs about the ideal mother converged strongly with the concept of sensitivity and within and across cultural groups of mothers and professionals. These findings point to a cognitive match on sensitivity beliefs between mothers and professionals with different cultural backgrounds. Our findings suggest that early childhood parenting interventions focused on enhancing sensitivity fit the beliefs of mothers of young children in different cultural groups.","2015-05","2018-12-21 18:00:42","2018-12-21 18:00:42","","1295-1306","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alliance; Beliefs; Culture; Maternal sensitivity; Socioeconomic status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests the hypothesis that omega-3 supplementation over 6months will reduce behavior problems in children both at the end of treatment and at 6months post treatment. MethodsIn this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, parallel-group trial, a community sample of 8-16year old children were randomized into a treatment group (N=100) and a placebo-control group (N=100). The supplementation consisted of a fruit drink containing 1g/day of omega-3 or a placebo consisting of the same fruit drink without omega-3. Participants, caregivers, and research assistants were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome measures of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems were reported by both caregivers and their children in a laboratory setting at 0months (baseline), 6months (end of treatment) and 12months (6months post treatment), together with the secondary outcome measures of parental antisocial behavior. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis including all participants. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: ResultsSignificant groupxtime interactions were observed with the treatment group showing long-term improvements in child behavior problems. The average posttreatment effect size was d=-.59. Effects were documented for parent reports, but with the exception of proactive and reactive aggression, child-report data were nonsignificant. Parents whose children took omega-3 showed significant posttreatment reductions in their own antisocial and aggressive behavior. This improvement in caregiver behavior partly mediated the improvements observed in child behavior. ConclusionsFindings provide initial evidence that omega-3 supplementation can produce sustained reductions in externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Results are the first to report improvements in caregiver behavior, and to establish this improvement as a part-mechanism for the efficacy of omega-3.","2015-05","2018-12-21 18:00:42","2018-12-21 18:00:42","","509-520","","5","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aggression; externalizing; internalizing; Omega-3; randomized trial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Participants (N = 376) with aMCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were studied over a median period of 36 months. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to assess the association between anxiety severity ratings on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and AD risk. Other variables were depression, memory loss, and MRI-derived AD-related regions of interest (ROIs), including hippocampal, amygdalar, entorhinal cortical (EC) volumes, and EC thickness, In addition, a linear regression model was used to determine the effect of anxiety in aMCI on rates of atrophy within ROIs. Results: Anxiety severity increased rate of aMCI conversion to AD, after controlling for depression and cognitive decline. The association between anxiety and AD remained significant even with inclusion of ROI baseline values or atrophy rates as explanatory variables. Further, anxiety status predicted greater rates of decrease in EC volume. An association between anxiety and EC thickness missed significance. Conclusion: Anxiety symptoms in aMCI predict conversion to AD, over and beyond the effects of depression, memory loss, or atrophy within AD neuroimaging biomarkers. These findings, together with the greater EC atrophy rate predicted by anxiety, are compatible with the hypothesis that anxiety is not a prodromal noncognitive feature of AD but may accelerate decline toward AD through direct or indirect effects on EC.","2015-05","2018-12-21 18:00:43","2018-12-21 18:00:43","","466-476","","5","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alzheimer disease; amygdala; anxiety; depression; entorhinal cortex; mild cognitive impairment; MRI biomarker; neuropsychiatric symptoms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used the Research Domain Criteria consensus as a guide to develop Engage, a streamlined, neurobiology-based psychotherapy for late-life depression that may match the skill set of practicing clinicians. This proof of concept study tested the hypotheses that Engage is bioequivalent to Problem Solving Therapy (PST) in reducing depressive symptoms, inducing remission, and ameliorating disability. Methods: Engage assumes that abnormal function of the positive valence systems fuels depression and uses “reward exposure” (engagement in meaningful, rewarding activities) as its principal intervention. Negativity bias, apathy, and emotional dysregulation are expressions of abnormalities in the negative valence, arousal and regulatory, and cognitive control systems, respectively. Engage targets each of them with simple interventions only if they interfere with reward exposure. We treated openly, with 9 weekly sessions of Engage, 39 older adults with unipolar major depression. We compared their course of depression (HAM-D), remission rate (HAM-D<10), and disability (WHODAS) with those of a historical comparison group (N=97) treated with 9 weekly sessions of PST. Results: Community social workers and research therapists required one third as much training time in Engage as in PST. Engage was non-inferior to PST in reducing HAM-D and WHODAS. Remission rates for Engage at 6 and 9 weeks were 18.2% and 41.1%, respectively. The corresponding figures for PST were 13.7% and 35.0%, respectively. Conclusion: These initial observations suggest that Engage has comparable efficacy with PST in reducing depressive symptoms and disability and warrants a randomized controlled trial.","2015-05","2018-12-21 18:00:44","2018-12-21 18:00:44","","506-513","","5","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Late-life depression; neurobiology-based; psychotherapy; RDoC consensus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To elucidate this issue, the current study tested the hypothesis that young infants' segmentation of visual sequences depends on redundant statistical cues to segmentation. A sample of 20 2-month-olds and 20 5-month-olds observed a continuous sequence of looming shapes in which unit boundaries were defined by both transitional probability and co-occurrence frequency. Following habituation, only 5-month-olds showed evidence of statistically segmenting the sequence, looking longer to a statistically improbable shape pair than to a probable pair. These results reaffirm the power of statistical learning in infants as young as 5 months but also suggest considerable development of statistical segmentation ability between 2 and 5 months of age. Moreover, the results do not support the idea that infants' ability to segment visual sequences based on transitional probabilities and/or co-occurrence frequencies is functional at the onset of visual experience, as has been suggested previously. Rather, this type of statistical segmentation appears to be constrained by the developmental state of the learner. Factors contributing to the development of statistical segmentation ability during early infancy, including memory and attention, are discussed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We tested the hypothesis that maternal depression is associated with DNA methylation alterations in maternal T lymphocytes, neonatal cord blood T lymphocytes and adult offspring hippocampi. Genome-wide DNA methylation of CD3+ T lymphocytes isolated from 38 antepartum maternal and 44 neonatal cord blood samples were analyzed using Illumina Methylation 450 K microarrays. Previously obtained methylation data sets using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and array-hybridization of 62 postmortem hippocampal samples of adult males were re-analyzed to test associations with history of maternal depression. We found 145 (false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05) and 2520 (FDR q < 0.1) differentially methylated CG-sites in cord blood T lymphocytes of neonates from the maternal depression group as compared with the control group. However, no significant DNA methylation differences were detected in the antepartum maternal T lymphocytes of our preliminary data set. We also detected 294 differentially methylated probes (FDR q < 0.1) in hippocampal samples associated with history of maternal depression. We observed a significant overlap (P = 0.002) of 33 genes with changes in DNA methylation in T lymphocytes of neonates and brains of adult offspring. Many of these genes are involved in immune system functions. Our results show that DNA methylation changes in offspring associated with maternal depression are detectable at birth in the immune system and persist to adulthood in the brain. This is consistent with the hypothesis that system-wide epigenetic changes are involved in life-long responses to maternal depression in the offspring.","2015-04-07","2018-12-21 18:00:46","2018-12-21 18:00:46","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used the concreteness effect to test the hypothesis that semantic encoding in standard verbal STM tasks is a consequence of controlled, attention-demanding mechanisms of strategic semantic retrieval and encoding. Experiment 1 analysed the effect of presentation rate, with slow presentations being assumed to benefit strategic, time-dependent semantic encoding. Experiments 2 and 3 provided a more direct test of the strategic hypothesis by introducing three different concurrent attention-demanding tasks. Although Experiment 1 showed a larger concreteness effect with slow presentations, the following two experiments yielded strong evidence against the strategic hypothesis. Limiting available attention resources by concurrent tasks reduced global memory performance, but the concreteness effect was equivalent to that found in control conditions. We conclude that semantic effects in STM result from automatic semantic encoding and provide tentative explanations for the interaction between the concreteness effect and the presentation rate.","2015-04-03","2018-12-21 18:00:47","2018-12-21 18:00:47","","759-778","","4","68","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Concreteness effect; Dual task paradigm; Immediate serial recall; Presentation rate; Verbal short-term memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results demonstrate that listeners' consideration of competing alternatives with different stress patterns (e.g., `jury/gi'raffe) can be influenced by the fundamental frequency and syllable timing patterns across material preceding a target word. When preceding stressed syllables distal to the target word shared pitch and timing characteristics with the first syllable of the target word, pictures of alternatives with primary lexical stress on the first syllable (e.g., jury) initially attracted more looks than alternatives with unstressed initial syllables (e.g., giraffe). This effect was modulated when preceding unstressed syllables had pitch and timing characteristics similar to the initial syllable of the target word, with more looks to alternatives with unstressed initial syllables (e.g., giraffe) than to those with stressed initial syllables (e.g., jury). These findings suggest that expectations about the acoustic realization of upcoming speech include information about metrical organization and lexical stress and that these expectations constrain the initial interpretation of suprasegmental stress cues. These distal prosody effects implicate online probabilistic inferences about the sources of acoustic-phonetic variation during spoken-word recognition.","2015-04","2018-12-21 18:00:48","2018-12-21 18:00:48","","306-323","","2","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","expectations; lexical competition; lexical stress; prosody; spoken-word recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present fMRI study, we tested the hypothesis that the biological dimension of sound modulates the involvement of the motor system in human auditory perception, using musical tasks. We first localized the vocal motor cortex in each participant. Then we compared the BOLD response to vocal, semi-vocal and non-vocal melody perception, and found greater activity for voice perception in the right sensorimotor cortex. We additionally ran a psychophysiological interaction analysis with the right sensorimotor as a seed, showing that the vocal dimension of the stimuli enhanced the connectivity between the seed region and other important nodes of the auditory dorsal stream. Finally, the participants' vocal ability was negatively correlated to the voice effect in the Inferior Parietal Lobule. These results suggest that the biological dimension of singing-voice impacts the activity within the auditory dorsal stream, probably via a facilitated matching between the perceived sound and the participant motor representations.

Less focus has been directed towards explaining social deficits and heightened risk of revictimization observed among individuals with PTSD related to physical or sexual assault. The purpose of the present study was to foster more comprehensive theoretical models of PTSD by testing the hypothesis that assault-related PTSD is associated with behavioral impairments in a social trust and reciprocity task and corresponding alterations in the neural encoding of social learning mechanisms. Adult women with assault-related PTSD (n = 25) and control women (n = 15) completed a multi-trial trust game outside of the MRI scanner. A subset of these participants (15 with PTSD and 14 controls) also completed a social and non-social reinforcement learning task during 3T fMRI. Brain regions that encoded the computationally modeled parameters of value expectation, prediction error, and volatility (i.e., uncertainty) were defined and compared between groups. The PTSD group demonstrated slower learning rates during the trust game and social prediction errors had a lesser impact on subsequent investment decisions. PTSD was also associated with greater encoding of negative expected social outcomes in perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral middle frontal gyri, and greater encoding of social prediction errors in the left temporoparietal junction. These data suggest mechanisms of PTSD-related deficits in social functioning and heightened risk for re-victimization in assault victims; however, comorbidity in the PTSD group and the lack of a trauma-exposed control group temper conclusions about PTSD specifically.

AimsThe aims of this study were to investigate categorisation of offenders with psychosis as early or late starters or late first offenders, and test the hypotheses that, compared with non-offenders with psychosis, early starters would be characterised by low educational or occupational achievement, negative childhood experiences and early substance use, whereas positive psychotic symptoms would characterise late starters or late first offenders. MethodsA retrospective file study was conducted, yielding 97 early starters, 100 late starters and 26 late first offenders identified from a specialist inpatient forensic mental health assessment service and 129 non-offenders identified from general psychiatric services in the same geographic region, all with schizophreniform psychoses. ResultsWe found little difference between early and later starters in terms of measured antecedents, but substance misuse was up to 20 times less likely among late first offenders. Persecutory and/or grandiose delusions were more strongly associated with each offender group compared with non-offenders, most so with late first offenders. ConclusionsOur findings underscore the importance of treating delusions - for safety as well as health. Childhood antecedents may be less important indicators of offender sub-types among people with psychosis than previously thought. When patients present with grandiose or persecutory delusions over the age of 35years without co-morbid substance misuse disorders, but with a history of childhood neglect and low educational achievement, particular care should be taken to assess risk of violence.

AimAs part of a wider evaluation of the first youth justice diversion scheme outside the USA, our aim here was to examine re-offending. We sought to test the hypothesis that a specialised service for young people with mental health difficulties would be associated with reductions in re-offending. In addition, we examined factors associated with the re-offending that occurred. MethodsTwo hundred and eight young offenders with access to the diversion scheme and 200 without were compared in four geographical area pairings to allow for socio-demographic contextual differences. Officially recorded re-offending was ascertained for 15-30months after study entry. We also tested characteristics associated with re-offending among everyone entering the diversion scheme (n=870). ResultsThere was no statistically significant difference in re-offending rates between the diversion and comparison samples, but those with access to diversion had significantly longer periods of desistance from offending than those who did not. In multivariate analysis, the only significant characteristic associated with re-offending was history of previous offending. ConclusionsPrevention of re-offending is only one of the potentially beneficial outcomes of diversion of young people who are vulnerable because of mental health problems, but it is an important one. The advantage of longer survival without prevention of re-offending suggests that future research should explore critical timings for these young people. The equivocal nature of the findings suggests that a randomised controlled trial would be justified.

The current research tested the hypothesis that an individual's level of power would influence that person's level of social affiliative motivation. We predicted that, compared with participants in a control condition, (1) individuals who possess power would exhibit less social affiliative motivation; and (2) individuals who lack power would display greater social affiliative motivation. Although we found little evidence to support the former prediction, we observed consistent evidence across two experiments that supported the latter. In Experiment 1, priming participants with low power (versus control) led them to display greater interest in joining a campus service aimed at fostering new friendships among students. In Experiment 2, placing participants in a position of low power (versus control) led them to seek greater proximity to a partner. Together, these results suggest that lacking power motivates people to seek social affiliation.

Markers of NO dysregulation have been found in individuals with depression without cardiovascular disease. Because depression is associated with poor HF outcomes, the present study tested the hypothesis that depression is associated with a dysregulated NO pathway in patients with HF. Methods Serum levels of NO regulation (l-arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine [ADMA], and symmetric dimethylarginine [SDMA]) and oxidative stress (isoprostane 8-epi prostaglandin F-2) were measured in 104 patients with HF (mean [standard deviation] age = 65.7 [8.4] years, 28% women) at baseline and 12 months. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory. The associations between depressive symptoms with markers of NO regulation were examined with mixed-model analysis, adjusted for age, sex, time of assessment, left ventricular ejection fraction, creatinine, and hypertension. Results Depressive symptoms were correlated with a lower l-arginine/ADMA ratio (r = -0.22, p = .003) and higher SDMA levels (r = 0.28, p < .001). Associations were similar for somatic depressive symptoms and cognitive-affective symptoms (l-arginine/ADMA ratio: r = -0.20 [p = .009] versus r = -0.19 [p = .013]; ADMA: r = 0.16 [p = .043] versus r = 0.10 [p = .20]; SDMA: r = 0.27 [p < .001] versus r = 0.22 [p = .005], respectively). No associations were found between depressive symptoms and isoprostane. The association between depression and the l-arginine/ADMA ratio remained significant in multivariate adjusted models. Conclusions Depressive symptoms were associated with markers of NO dysregulation, particularly the l-arginine/ADMA ratio and SDMA, in patients with HF. The lower l-arginine/ADMA ratio indicates less available NO, suggesting that NO-related endothelial dysfunction may play a role in the adverse risk of HF progression associated with depression.","2015-04","2018-12-21 18:00:53","2018-12-21 18:00:53","","292-302","","3","77","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","depressive symptoms; heart failure; isoprostane; methylarginines; nitric oxide regulation; oxidative stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Older participants demanded higher shares for themselves than younger participants, even under the low certainty condition in the highly attractive reward scenario. Particularly in this scenario, older participants increased their portions immediately after receiving rejections. Moreover, they consistently expected the recipients to accept their offers regardless of the proposed distribution amount or bargaining conditions. It was implied that the high attractiveness of the rewards made it difficult for older individuals to predict the recipient's view of their proposals and thus contributed to them making selfish proposals.","2015-04","2018-12-21 18:00:54","2018-12-21 18:00:54","","91-102","","2","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bargaining; expectations; older people; ultimatum game","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study tested the hypothesis that the relation between binge eating and urgency would be moderated by emotional awareness, over and above negative affect. Participants were 249 female college students. Items from the Trait Meta Mood Scale (TMMS), the Urgency subscale of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, and the Bulimia (B) subscale of the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-3) were administered. As predicted, emotional awareness moderated the link between urgency and binge eating. Both Urgency x Attention to emotions and Urgency x Clarity of emotions significantly predicted binge eating scores, even after taking into account negative affect. Consistent with past research, higher levels of urgency were associated with higher levels of binge eating, even after taking negative affect into account. However, the associations were particularly strong among individuals with low levels of attention to emotions and low levels of clarity of emotions.

Both family history of obesity and personal dieting history have been established as predictors of future weight gain; however, it is unknown if they are independent or overlapping predictors. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree of overlap between these two predictors using cross-sectional data. Baseline data from four studies were examined separately and in combination for a total of 561 female participants, and analyses were conducted to examine parent anthropometric variables by dieting status within and across studies. All participants were female university students between the ages of 17 and 30. For each study, as well as for the entire sample combined, parent anthropometric variables were examined by dieting status using factorial ANOVAs. No meaningful pattern was found when examining parent anthropometric variables by dieting status, which suggests that the two risk factors are largely independent. This suggests that the processes associated with the development of future weight gain by each variable are different; therefore, future research should use a longitudinal study to test the hypothesis that using both variables to predict future weight gain would account for more variance than using either variable alone.

Specifically, self-affirmation has been found to reduce psychological defenses against self-esteem threats. The current research examined the effects of self-affirmation on more basic reflexive mechanisms of motivation and emotion. The startle-eyeblink response is a defensive reflex that can be elicited by loud bursts of noise and is potentiated in the presence of threatening stimuli. Individual differences in anxiety-related traits, including behavioral inhibition-system (BIS) sensitivity, predict the magnitude of threat-potentiated startle responses, such that higher BIS sensitivity corresponds with more intense responses to threatening stimuli. The current experiment (N = 100) tested the hypothesis that affirming a core personal value breaks the link between BIS sensitivity and threat responsiveness. We measured individual differences in BIS, manipulated the opportunity for self-affirmation, and assessed eyeblink responses to startle probes during negative, neutral, and positive emotional picture viewing. In the no-affirmation condition, BIS sensitivity predicted the magnitude of startle-eyeblink responses during negative pictures, consistent with previous research. In the self-affirmation condition, the relationship between BIS sensitivity and threat-potentiated startle responding was eliminated. This finding suggests that self-affirmation's effects extend beyond self-esteem defenses to influence basic defensive reflexes in threat-prone individuals.","2015-04","2018-12-21 18:00:57","2018-12-21 18:00:57","","146-150","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","behavioral inhibition system; self-affirmation; startle-eyeblink response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the hypothesized relation between early walking experience and the tuning of these responses in three primary gait muscles of participants in four subgroups: cruisers (n = 7) and toddlers with one (n = 5), two (n = 5), or three (n = 5) months of walking experience. Reflex responses in multiple la pathways - tendon reflex (T-reflex), vibration-induced inhibition of the T-reflex (VIM-T-reflex), and tonic vibration-induced reflex (VIR), were elicited by mechanical stimuli applied to the distal tendons of the quadriceps, gastrocnemius-soleus, and tibialis anterior of both legs. Walking skill was assessed via a GAITRite mat. Generally, walking experience seemed to be related to slowly emerging improvements and, depending on muscle tested and pathway, progress was quite varied. Amplitude and latency of reflex responses were more clearly impacted by age or leg length while the ratio or distribution pattern of reflex response among antagonist pairs of muscles was impacted by walking experience and skill. As walking experience increased, the ratio of reflex responses tended to increase for the stimulated and decrease for the antagonist reflex loops with distribution of the pattern shifting gradually toward a single type of reflex response in all tested muscles. The very slow tuning of these reflexes may underlie the many missteps and falls reported to occur during early walking and suggest that subsequent studies should continue to follow the developmental trajectory through the first year of walking experience.

Six elite male cross-country skiers performed two pretesting time-trials (TT) to determine their best performances and to choose an appropriate submaximal speed for collection of physiological, biomechanical and neuromuscular data during two experimental sessions ((exp)). Each skier used, in randomized order, either the classical (CL) or skating technique (SK) for the first 3-km loop, followed by transition to the skating technique for the second 3-km loop. Respiratory parameters were recorded continuously. The EMG activity of the triceps brachii (TBr and vastus lateralis (VLa) muscles during isometric contractions performed when the skiers were stationary (i.e., just before the first loop, during the transition, and after the second loop); their corresponding activity during dynamic contractions; and pole and plantar forces during the second loop were recorded. During the second 3-km of the `IT, skating speed was significantly higher for the SK-SK than CL-SK. During this second loop, AEE was also higher (+1.5%) for CL-SKexp than SK-SKexp, in association with higher VLa EMG activity during both isometric and dynamic contractions, despite no differences in plantar or pole forces, poling times or cycle rates. Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, during a skiathlon, the transition between the sections of classical skiing and skating alters skating performance (i.e., skiing speed), AEE and neuromuscular function.

MethodMeasures of childhood sexual abuse, maternal care, and MST were administered to 197 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. ResultsAfter accounting for gender, age, and the main effects of maternal care and childhood sexual abuse, the maternal care x childhood sexual abuse interaction was a significant predictor of MST (odds ratio = .28, = -1.26, 95% confidence intervals of .10, .80). As hypothesized, rates of MST were higher among veterans who reported childhood sexual abuse and low levels of maternal care (43%) compared with veterans who reported childhood sexual abuse and high levels of maternal care (11%). ConclusionThese findings suggest that high levels of maternal care may act as a protective factor against future revictimization among military service members. These findings have the potential to inform both prevention and intervention efforts.

To address this, participants judged the heights of people as they walked past. We tested the hypothesis that differences between participant and target height account for systematic patterns of variability and bias in height estimation. Height estimate error and error variability increased as the difference between participant height and target height increased, suggesting that estimates are scaled to observers' heights. Furthermore, participants' height estimates were biased toward two standards, demonstrating classic category effects. First, estimates were biased toward participants' own heights. Second, participants biased height estimates toward the average height of the target distribution. These results support past research on using both the body and categorical information to estimate target properties but extend to real-world situations involving interactions with moving people, such as height judgments provided during eyewitness testimony.","2015-04","2018-12-21 18:01:00","2018-12-21 18:01:00","","566-571","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bias; Body-scaling; Category effects; Height estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose The purpose of this study was to test if depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between hopelessness and cortisol, a measure of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis. Methods Hopelessness, depressive symptoms, and diurnal cortisol rhythm were measured in 257 adults (128 women and 129 men; age range, 20-74 years) in this cross-sectional study. To test the hypothesis, two linear regression analyses and asymmetrical confidence intervals around the regression weights were conducted. A second set of analyses was calculated to be able to exclude the possibility of hopelessness as a mediator between depressive symptoms and cortisol. Results As predicted, after adjusting for age, gender, awakening time, and medication use, more hopelessness predicted more depressive symptoms and more depressive symptoms predicted a flatter diurnal cortisol rhythm. The 95 % confidence intervals revealed that the indirect relationship between hopelessness and diurnal cortisol rhythm was significant. The analyses with hopelessness as a potential mediator revealed that hopelessness does not mediate the association between depressive symptoms and cortisol. Conclusions While the relationship between hopelessness and cortisol was mediated by depressive symptoms in this cross-sectional study, many other risk factors of depression have not been examined. Thus, future longitudinal studies should examine the relationships between those risk factors of depression and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis.","2015-04","2018-12-21 18:01:01","2018-12-21 18:01:01","","251-257","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cross-sectional study; Depressive symptoms.; Diurnal cortisol rhythm; Hopelessness; Mediation model; Population-based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing literature shows that ambiguity aversion often persists even when these probability distributions are explicitly described to decision makers. We test the hypothesis that exposure to these probability distributions via sampling experience, rather than description, will lead to a reduction in ambiguity aversion. We used the classic two-colour Ellsberg task in which the participants were asked to choose to bet on either a risky bet (i.e. probabilities were known) or (versions of) an ambiguous bet (i.e. exact probabilities were unknown). Different probability distributions, each providing subtly different information about the underlying properties of the ambiguous bet, were either experienced through sampling or described to participants prior to choice. Overall, the results indicated that people demonstrated ambiguity-neutral attitudes when the underlying probability distributions were experienced. In contrast, when described, attitudes toward ambiguity changed as a function of the type of probability distribution. Additional analyses confirmed that decision makers were less likely to be ambiguity-averse when their individual experiences were positive during sampling trials (i.e. observing distributions with winning being more likely or more frequent).

Participants, ages 8-18, watched a video depicting a route through a virtual environment. The location at which landmarks occurred was manipulated to test the hypothesis that memory processes vary as a function of context. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data was acquired while participants performed an old new recognition memory test of the landmarks. Old compared to new landmarks recruited a network of regions including the hippocampus and the inferior/middle frontal gyrus in all participants. Developmental differences were observed in the functional organization of the parahippocampal gyrus and the anterior ungulate cortex, such that memory representations strengthened linearly with age only when the associated spatial context was relevant for navigation. These results support the view that medial temporal lobe regions become increasingly specialized with development; these changes may be responsible for the development of successful navigation strategies.","2015-03-06","2018-12-21 18:01:04","2018-12-21 18:01:04","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anterior cingulate cortex; cognitive development; landmarks; medial temporal lobe; navigation; spatial memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The amygdala is a key nucleus involved in the autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to stress. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that prolonged exposure of the central amygdala (CeA) to stress or the stress hormone cortisol (or corticosterone in rats) induces nociceptive behaviors mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) within the CeA. We selectively knocked down CRF in the CeA via antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASO) in animals with targeted, stereotaxically placed corticosterone (CORT) micropellets or following repeated water avoidance stress (WAS). CRF expression in the CeA was analyzed concurrently with the assessment of visceral hypersensitivity to colonic distension and mechanical somatic withdrawal threshold. The responses were characterized at 7 or 28 days post implantation of the CORT micropellet or following 7 days of WAS. Exposure of the CeA to elevated CORT or WAS increased CRF expression and heightened visceral and somatic sensitivity. Infusion of CRF ASO into the CeA decreased CRF expression and attenuated visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in both models. Our study provides important evidence for a CRF mediated mechanism specifically within the CeA that regulates stress-induced visceral and somatic nociception.","2015-03-03","2018-12-21 18:01:07","2018-12-21 18:01:07","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Noradrenergic (NA) neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) are considered to play a role in these changes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NTS NA A2 neurons are required for cardiovascular and HPA axis responses to both acute and chronic stress. Adult male rats received bilateral microinjection into the NTS of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to lesion A2 neurons [cardiovascular study, n = 5; HPA study, n = 5] or vehicle [ cardiovascular study, n = 6; HPA study, n = 4]. Rats were exposed to acute restraint stress followed by 14 d of chronic variable stress (CVS). On the last day of testing, rats were placed in a novel elevated plus maze (EPM) to test post-CVS stress responses. Lesions of NTS A2 neurons reduced the tachycardic response to acute restraint, confirming that A2 neurons promote sympathetic activation following acute stress. In addition, CVS increased the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power for heart rate variability, indicative of sympathovagal imbalance, and this effect was significantly attenuated by 6-OHDA lesion. Lesions of NTS A2 neurons reduced acute restraint-induced corticosterone secretion, but did not affect the corticosterone response to the EPM, indicating that A2 neurons promote acute HPA axis responses, but are not involved in CVS-mediated HPA axis sensitization. Collectively, these data indicate that A2 neurons promote both cardiovascular and HPA axis responses to acute stress. Moreover, A2 catecholaminergic neurons may contribute to the potentially deleterious enhancement of sympathetic drive following chronic stress.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:08","2018-12-21 18:01:08","","221-232","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Acute stress; chronic variable stress; corticosterone; elevated plus maze; heart rate; heart rate variability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While research on non-human animal species indicates that PA may confer protective effects on mental health by increasing resilience to stress via regulation of the stress response, the human literature offers inconsistent evidence regarding this idea. To help reconcile these inconsistencies, the present study of human adults tested the hypothesis that PA's protective effects, as indexed by self-perceived resilience, vary according to individual differences in trait anxiety, which has been linked to a dysregulated stress response and risk for developing mental health problems. Specifically, we predicted that individuals reporting high trait anxiety (and thus presumably more stress response dysregulation) would show a stronger association between PA and self-perceived resilience, than would peers with lower reported trait anxiety. Methods: Undergraduate students (n = 222) completed online self-report measures regarding their PA level, trait anxiety, and self-perceived resilience. Results: Hierarchical linear regression analyses yielded evidence of a significant interaction between trait anxiety level and PA, such that PA and self-perceived resilience were significantly and positively associated among individuals with high trait anxiety, but not among individuals with low and moderate trait anxiety. Discussion: In conclusion, individuals with high trait anxiety, which may be a risk factor for developing clinically significant mental health problems, may preferentially show psychological, as well as physiological, benefits from PA.

Two enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade are the prostaglandin D synthase (PTGDS), which catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2 (PGD(2)), and the aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3), which catalyzes the reduction of PGD(2). We aimed to test the hypothesis that mRNA expression of PTGDS and AKR1C3 is deregulated in rapid-cycling disorder patients in a euthymic or current affective state compared with healthy control subjects, and that expression alters with affective states. Methods: PTGDS and AKR1C3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured in 37 rapid-cycling bipolar disorder patients and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects using reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Repeated measurements of PTGDS and AKR1C3 mRNA expression were obtained in various affective states during 6-12 months and compared with repeated measurements in healthy control subjects. Results: Adjusted for age and gender, PTGDS mRNA expression was down-regulated in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder patients in a euthymic, depressive, and manic/hypomanic state compared with healthy control subjects. No difference in PTGDS mRNA expression was observed between affective states. AKR1C3 mRNA expression did not differ between bipolar disorder patients in any affective state or in comparison with healthy control subjects. Conclusions: The results suggest a role for aberrantly-regulated PTGDS mRNA expression in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. The sample size was limited; replication of the findings in larger, independent samples is warranted to further explore the role of the arachidonic acid cascade and prostaglandin metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in bipolar disorder.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:10","2018-12-21 18:01:10","","","","5","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","AKR1C3; biomarker; bipolar disorder; PTGDS; rapid cycling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this objective, Iraq/Afghanistan war veterans (N=155) completed a screening questionnaire that assessed a wide range of psychiatric symptoms along with a measure of warzone experiences. As expected, returning veterans reported significant elevations across a wide range of clinical scales. Approximately three-fourths screened positive on at least one clinical subscale, and a one-third screened positive on five or more. In addition, nearly all of these conditions were associated with veterans' warzone experiences (average r=0.36); however, this association was much stronger among veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (average r=033) than among veterans without PTSD (average r=0.15). We also observed that approximately 18% of the variance in total psychiatric symptomatology was attributable to warzone experiences above and beyond the effects of childhood trauma and demographic factors. Taken together, these findings suggest that returning veterans experience a broad array of psychiatric symptoms that are strongly associated with their warzone experiences.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that LUTS are associated with anxiety and depression using a nationwide population-based database in Taiwan. Data were obtained from a random population sample of about one million enrollees in the National Health Insurance program from 2001 to 2009, and consisted of 22,980 LUTS patients and 45,960 matched controls. The records of healthcare seeking for anxiety and depression were collected 2 years before and after the diagnosis of LUTS. The results showed that patients with LUTS had a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety or depression than the matched controls (11.45% vs. 5.72%). After controlling for sociodemographic variables and other major systemic diseases, the odds ratios for anxiety, depression, either anxiety or depression, and both anxiety and depression, were 2.05, 2.19, 2.14, and 2.56, respectively.

A multimodal MRI investigation","JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE","","1180-4882","10.1503/jpn.140082","","Background: Neuroimaging studies of ultra-high risk (UHR) and first-episode psychosis (FEP) have revealed widespread alterations in brain structure and function. Recent evidence suggests there is an intrinsic relationship between these 2 types of alterations; however, there is very little research linking these 2 modalities in the early stages of psychosis. Methods: To test the hypothesis that functional alteration in UHR and FEP participants would be associated with corresponding structural alteration, we examined brain function and structure in these participants as well as in a group of healthy controls using multimodal MRI. The data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping. Results: We included 24 participants in the FEP group, 18 in the UHR group and 21 in the control group. Patients in the FEP group showed a reduction in functional activation in the left superior temporal gyrus relative to controls, and the UHR group showed intermediate values. The same region showed a corresponding reduction in grey matter volume in the FEP group relative to controls. However, while the difference in grey matter volume remained significant after including functional activation as a covariate of no interest, the reduction in functional activation was no longer evident after including grey matter volume as a covariate of no interest. Limitations: Our sample size was relatively small. All participants in the FEP group and 2 in the UHR group had received antipsychotic medication, which may have impacted neurofunction and/or neuroanatomy. Conclusion: Our results suggest that superior temporal dysfunction in early psychosis is accounted for by a corresponding alteration in grey matter volume. This finding has important implications for the interpretation of functional alteration in early psychosis.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:12","2018-12-21 18:01:12","","100-107","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sample of 1281 adolescents (593 girls and 688 boys, Mean Age = 13.61 years) were assessed at three time points separated by 6 months. They completed measures of three domains of the EMS (disconnection/rejection, impaired autonomy, and other-directedness), social and achievement stressors, depressive symptoms, and social anxiety. Latent growth curve modeling was used to test the hypothesis of the study. Findings indicate that disconnection/rejection, impaired autonomy, and other-directedness domains are associated to levels of depressive and social anxiety symptoms and predict a higher stability of depressive symptoms over time. There was no consistent, significant interactions between EMS and stressors in the prediction of symptoms. The only exceptions took place in the subsample of male adolescents, in which social stressors interacted with both disconnection/rejection and other-directedness domains in predicting levels of depressive symptoms. Early maladaptive schemas may be formed by adolescence so that they can predict future depressive and social anxiety symptoms. EMS operate relatively independent of stress levels. Identifying schema profiles has implications for interventions in depression and social anxiety in adolescents.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:12","2018-12-21 18:01:12","","85-99","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescents; Depression; Early maladaptive schemas; Social anxiety; Stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have previously suggested that this association is due to delayed primacy performance indexing memory consolidation, which in turn is thought to depend upon hippocampal function. Here, we test the hypothesis that hippocampal size is associated with delayed primacy performance in cognitively intact elderly individuals. Data were analyzed from a group (N=81) of cognitively intact participants, aged 60 or above. Serial position performance was measured with the Buschke selective reminding test (BSRT). Hippocampal size was automatically measured via MRI, and unbiased voxel-based analyses were also conducted to explore further regional specificity of memory performance. We conducted regression analyses of hippocampus volumes on serial position performance; other predictors included age, family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD), APOE epsilon 4 status, education, and total intracranial volume. Our results collectively suggest that there is a preferential association between hippocampal volume and delayed primacy performance. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that delayed primacy consolidation is associated with hippocampal size, and shed light on the relationship between delayed primacy performance and generalized cognitive decline in cognitively intact individuals, suggesting that delayed primacy consolidation may serve as a sensitive marker of hippocampal health in these individuals.

The present study tested the hypothesis that school climate counteracts youths' home-school risk by examining the moderating effects of students' school climate perceptions on the relationship between family structure (i.e., two-parent, one-parent, foster-care, and homeless households), and academic performance (i.e., self-reported [grade point average] GPA). The present sample consisted of 902 California public high schools, including responses from over 490,000 students in Grades 9 and 11. Results indicated that, regardless of family structure, students with more positive school climate perceptions self-reported higher GPAs. Youths with two-parent, one-parent, and homeless family structures displayed stepwise, linear improvements in self-reported GPA as perceptions of climate improved. Foster-care students' positive school climate perceptions had a weaker effect on their self-reported GPA compared with students living in other family structures. A unique curvilinear trend was found for homeless students, as the relationship between their school climate perceptions and self-reported GPA was stronger at lower levels. Overall, the moderation effect of positive school climate perceptions on self-reported GPA was strongest for homeless youth and youth from one-parent homes, suggesting that school climate has a protective effect for students living in these family structures.

Methods: A randomized, controlled, repeated measures design was used to test the hypothesis that PA-CBT would lead to greater reductions in suicidality and depression compared with Adolescent Only CBT (AO-CBT). Participants included 24 adolescent and parent dyads in which the adolescent met American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) criteria for current major depressive episode (MDE) and the parent met DSM-IV criteria for current or past MDE. Results: The concurrent protocol was found to be feasible to implement with most depressed adolescents and parents. Adolescent ratings of program satisfaction were somewhat lower in PA-CBT, suggesting that some teens view treatment negatively when they are required to participate with a parent. The concurrent treatment protocol was more effective in reducing depressed mood in the parent-adolescent dyad at the end of maintenance treatment (24 weeks) than treating an adolescent alone for depression; the largest effect was on parental depressed mood. This difference between dyads was no longer significant, however, at the 48 week follow-up. Adolescent and parent suicidal ideation improved equally in both groups during active and maintenance treatment, and remained low at follow-up in both groups. Conclusions: The PA-CBT protocol is feasible to conduct and acceptable to most but not all adolescents. The strongest effect was on parental depressed mood. A larger study that has sufficient power to test efficacy and moderators of treatment outcome is necessary to better understand which adolescents would benefit most from concurrent treatment with a parent.","2015-03-01","2018-12-21 18:01:16","2018-12-21 18:01:16","","131-139","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that these difficulties stem from a deficit in semantic processing. Method: We tested and compared semantic processing in left and right TLE patients and healthy controls. To avoid the confound of word retrieval, we used two semantic tasks (semantic priming and picture-matching) that did not require spoken word production. In addition to accuracy, we recorded response time in an effort to achieve a sensitive assessment of semantic processing. Results: Semantic priming was in all respects comparable between left TLE patients with documented word-finding difficulty and right TLE patients without word-finding difficulty. Likewise, performances were comparable between groups on picture matching, which demanded knowledge of detailed semantic features for decisions regarding subtle differences in semantic relatedness. Conclusions: Overall, these results, which demonstrate a relative preservation of semantic processing in left TLE, suggest that the probable cause of word-finding difficulty in this group relates to processes that follow semantic retrieval in word production, involving the retrieval of lexical/phonological information. In addition to clinical implications for remediation, these results refine our understanding of the neurocognitive organization of temporal mechanisms supporting spoken word production.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:16","2018-12-21 18:01:16","","274-281","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","lexical processing; naming deficits; semantic processing; temporal lobe epilepsy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: At enrollment in a longitudinal cohort study, 964 older persons without cognitive impairment estimated years of foreign language and music instruction by age 18. Annually thereafter they completed clinical evaluations that included cognitive testing and clinical classification of MCI. Results: There were 264 persons with no foreign language instruction, 576 with 1-4 years, and 124 with > 4 years; 346 persons with no music instruction, 360 with 1-4 years, and 258 with > 4 years. During a mean of 5.8 years of observation, 396 participants (41.1%) developed MCI.

The association persisted after adjustment for other early life indicators of an enriched cognitive environment, and it was stronger for nonamnestic than amnestic MCI. Both foreign language and music instruction were associated with higher initial level of cognitive function, but neither instruction measure was associated with cognitive decline.

Attention function, a domain of cognition, is essential for daily tasks such as exercising, a form of planned physical activity. We tested the hypotheses that lower self-reported attention function in BCS would be associated with less exercise and higher body mass index (BMI) by comparing a group of 505 young BCS (45 years or younger at diagnosis and 3-8 years post-treatment) with 466 acquaintance controls (AC). MethodsThe groups were compared on self-reported physical and psychological outcomes. Mplus software was used to perform confirmatory structural equation modeling with a robust maximum likelihood estimator to evaluate hypothesized relationships among variables. The criteria for good model fit were having root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)<0.06, comparative fit index (CFI)>0.95, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)<0.08. Modification indices were used to better fit the model. ResultsThe final model demonstrated good fit, with RMSEA=0.05, CFI=0.98, and SRMR=0.03. After controlling for demographics, parameter estimates revealed that, compared with AC, young BCS reported worse attention function (p<0.001), more depressive symptoms (p<0.001), and more fatigue (p<0.001). Controlling for fatigue, depression, and anxiety, better attention function was associated with a greater likelihood of exercise in the past 3 months (p=0.039), which in turn was associated with a lower BMI (p<0.001). ConclusionsThe significant association between attention function and physical activity, if confirmed in a longitudinal study, will provide new targets for interventions aimed at improving physical activity and decreasing BMI among BCS.

The current experiment tested the hypothesis that targeting reasoning biases would result in change in delusions. Methods: One hundred and one participants with current delusions and schizophrenia spectrum psychosis were randomly allocated to a brief computerized reasoning training intervention or to a control condition involving computer-based activities of similar duration. The primary hypotheses tested were that the reasoning training intervention, would improve (1) data gathering and belief flexibility and (2) delusional thinking, specifically paranoia. We then tested whether the changes in paranoia were mediated by changes in data gathering and flexibility, and whether working memory and negative symptoms moderated any intervention effects. Results: On an intention-to-treat analysis, there were significant improvements in state paranoia and reasoning in the experimental compared with the control condition. There was evidence that changes in reasoning mediated changes in paranoia, although this effect fell just outside the conventional level of significance after adjustment for baseline confounders. Working memory and negative symptoms significantly moderated the effects of the intervention on reasoning. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the effectiveness of a brief reasoning intervention in improving both reasoning processes and paranoia. It thereby provides proof-of-concept evidence that reasoning is a promising intermediary target in interventions to ameliorate delusions, and thus supports the value of developing this approach as a longer therapeutic intervention.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:19","2018-12-21 18:01:19","","400-410","","2","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","belief flexibility; jumping to conclusions; mediators; psychosis; reasoning biases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding this association has the potential to critically bolster suicide prevention efforts. OBJECTIVES To examine the association between 12-month suicidality and 12-month psychotic experiences and to test the hypotheses that psychotic experiences are associated with increased prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during the concurrent period and with greater severity of suicidal behavior. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional survey datawere drawn from a large general population-based sample of households in the United States identified through the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (2001-2003). Adult household residents (n = 11,716) were selected using a clustered multistage sampling design with oversampling of racial/ethnic minority groups. Logistic regression models were adjusted for potential demographic confounders and co-occurring DSM-IV mental health conditions. EXPOSURES Twelve-month psychotic experiences assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0 psychosis screen. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Twelve-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. RESULTS Respondents reporting psychotic experiences were more likely to report concurrent suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR], 5.24; 95% CI, 2.85-9.62) and suicide attempts (OR, 9.48; 95% CI, 3.98-22.62). Most respondents with psychotic experiences (mean [SE], 65.2% [4.2%]) met criteria for a DSM-IV depressive, anxiety, or substance use disorder. Among respondents with suicidal ideation, those with psychotic experiences were likely to make an attempt during the concurrent 12-month period OR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.05-11.58) when adjusting for co-occurring psychiatric disorders. In contrast, depressive (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.62-4.52), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.40-6.09), and substance use disorders (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.24-11.17) did not reliably identify those at risk for attempts among respondents with suicidal ideation. The mean (SE) 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts among individuals reporting ideation and psychotic experiences and meeting criteria for any psychiatric disorder was 47.4%(10.9%) compared with 18.9%(4.8%) among those with just ideation and a disorder. Psychotic experiences were especially prevalent among individuals reporting severe attempts and may account for nearly one-third of attempts with intent to die (population attributable risk, 29.01%) in the United States annually. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Assessment of psychotic experiences among individuals with suicidal ideation has potential clinical and public health utility in reducing the prevalence of suicide attempts, particularly attempts with intent to die.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:20","2018-12-21 18:01:20","","219-225","","3","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, less is known about the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) and parenting behaviors on youth at elevated risk for mental health problems, such as teens seeking outpatient psychiatric care. This study examined whether family SES and parent positive communication were directly and indirectly associated with mental health symptoms 6 months later in urban teens seeking outpatient treatment, after accounting for baseline levels of symptoms. At baseline, adolescent participants (N = 346; 42 % female; 61 % African-American) ages 12-19 years old (M = 14.9; SD = 1.8) and their primary caregivers reported on SES and teen internalizing and externalizing symptoms and engaged in a videotaped discussion of a real-life conflict to assess parent positive communication. At 6-month follow-up, 81 % (N = 279) of families were retained and teens and caregivers again reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesized models with a sample of 338, using the full information likelihood method to adjust for missing data. For parent-reported externalizing symptoms, SEM revealed support for the indirect association of SES with follow-up externalizing symptoms via parent positive communication and externalizing symptoms at baseline. For parent reported internalizing symptoms, there was a direct association between SES and follow-up internalizing symptoms, but not an indirect effect via parent positive communication. Youth-reported symptoms were not associated with SES nor with parent positive communication. Current findings extend prior research on adolescent mental health in a diverse sample of urban youth seeking outpatient psychiatric care.

Good model fit indicated that maternal and offspring antisociality are linked, and antisocial behavior persists across childhood, but that these relationships are not dependent on the mother's age at primiparity. These results suggest that although maternal behavior predicts offspring antisociality, being the child of a teenage mother is not an independent risk factor for the development of antisociality. Given that mothers in general tend to transmit their antisocial behavior patterns, intervention for antisocial behavior patterns in females before or during adolescence should contribute to a significant lessening of not only their own behavior problems, but also the incidence of antisocial behavior in their future offspring.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:21","2018-12-21 18:01:21","","798-808","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Antisocial behavior; Cross-generational transmission; Teenage pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results: Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced in the AFL of patients with life time AVH compared to both healthy controls (Cohen's d=1.24) and patients without life time AVH (d=.72), including compared to the specific subsets of patientswithout AVH who either had hallucinations in other modalities (d=.69) or no history of any hallucinations (d=.73). Radial, but not axial, diffusivity was significantly increased in patientswith lifetime AVH compared to both healthy controls (d=.89) and patients without lifetime AVH (d=.39). Evidence was found for a non-linear relation between fractional anisotropy in the AFL and state AVH. Conclusion: Reduced integrity of the AFL is specifically associated with AVH, as opposed to schizophrenia in general or hallucinations in other modalities. Increased radial diffusivity suggests dysmyelination or demyelination of the AFL may play a role in AVH. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, these deficits may be manifestations of the genetic liability to schizophrenia and present in the non-psychotic first-degree relatives of that group. However, no study has examined task-based functional connectivity in schizophrenia relatives using independent component analysis (ICA). We employed group ICA to test the hypothesis that the unexpressed genetic liability to schizophrenia is reflected in the functional connectivity between brain regions during a task measuring context processing. We compared 20 schizophrenia patients and 32 patients' first-degree relatives to 22 controls demographically matched to the patients and 28 controls' relatives, respectively. The group ICA showed differential connectivity between patients and controls in a task-related network constituting right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and right posterior parietal lobe. A network constituting left MFG and left posterior parietal, which was also related to the context processing task, did not differ between groups. These findings demonstrate that connectivity abnormalities associated with the genetic liability to schizophrenia are most strongly expressed in a right lateralized executive fronto-parietal network, and that these abnormalities are linked to context processing impairments.

These are mainly studied with the alternating runs task-switching (ARTS) paradigm (in which the task changes every constant number of trials) or the cued task-switching (CTS) paradigm, in which the tasks change randomly. The authors tested the hypothesis that dealing with actual or potential conflicts regarding which task is currently required contribute to mixing cost in CTS more than in ARTS and contribute to switch costs more in ARTS than in CTS. This hypothesis was tested using ex-Gaussian modeling of reaction time (RT) distributions, in which the heaviness of the right tail marks task conflicts (Steinhauser and Hubner in J Exp Psychol Human Percept Perform 35:1398-1412 2009). As predicted, a heavier RT-distribution tail marked switch cost more strongly in ARTS than in CTS and marked mixing costs more strongly in CTS than in ARTS.

Twenty young, healthy participants memorized a melody without moving. Each tone in the memorized melody had previously been associated with a particular finger movement. For ten of the participants, the contour of the melody memorized was congruent to a subsequently performed, but never practiced, finger movement sequence (C group, n = 10). For the other ten participants, the melody memorized was incongruent to the subsequent finger movement sequence (InC group, n = 10). Results showed faster performance of the movement sequence in the C group than in the InC group. This difference in motor performance was most pronounced 6 h after melody learning and then dissipated over 30 days. These results provide evidence of a specific, crossmodal encoding of a movement sequence representation through an auditory sequence with the effect on motor performance lasting for several hours. The findings of this study are significant, as the formation of new motor memories through exposure to auditory stimuli may be useful in rehabilitation settings where the initial encoding of motor memories through physical training is disrupted.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:25","2018-12-21 18:01:25","","318-326","","2","79","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, we tested the hypothesis that time perspective may be one of the psychological mechanisms mediating the relationship between chronotype and socio-sexuality. Study participants were 95 heterosexual young men, most of whom were university students. Chronotype, life-history traits, socio-sexuality, and time perspective were assessed with well-established self-report measures. Variations in chronotype and in life-history traits were significantly associated in the direction predicted by our hypothesis. Consistent with our second hypothesis, time perspective emerged as a significant mediator of the association between chronotype and socio-sexuality so that the future orientation of morning-types was associated with their long-term mating orientation and relatively low sexual experience, while the present orientation of evening-types was associated with their short-term mating orientation and greater sexual experience.

The study is original because it uses two different scales to measure KSB. One KSB scale relates to the epistemological aspect of knowledge sharing: tacit and explicit. The other scale regards the involvement of the individual in KSB: conducting and participating. Data were collected from information technology organizations, involving 248 employees, working in teams. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the hypotheses. The results suggest that KSB influences IN and that that influence is partially mediated by AC. The use of different KSB scales had no effect on the results, which indicates the presence of the relationship regardless of the way in which the construct is operationalised. Employees seem to engage more in knowledge sharing participation than in knowledge sharing conduction. The findings also indicate that tacit knowledge is more widely shared than explicit knowledge.

Side effects of antidepressants are common and can adversely affect quality of life. Care managers address antidepressant side effects directly, but the impact of collaborative care on adverse effects is unknown. This secondary data analysis tested the hypothesis that patient-reported antidepressant side effects were lower for depressed patients receiving high-intensity, telemedicine-based collaborative care (TBCC) than for patients receiving low-intensity, practice-based collaborative care (PBCC). Methods: This analysis used data from 190 patients enrolled in a pragmatic, multisite, comparative-effectiveness trial from 2007 to 2009 and followed for 18 months. Most patients were female (83%) and Caucasian (80%). The mean age was 50. Patients randomly assigned to PBCC received 12 months of evidence-based care from an on-site primary care provider and nurse care manager. Patients in TBCC received evidence-based care from an on-site primary care provider supported by a nurse care manager available off site by telephone, as well as by a telepharmacist, telepsychologist, and telepsychiatrist. Telephone interviews completed at baseline, six, 12, and 18 months included assessments of sociodemographic characteristics, beliefs about antidepressant treatment, depression severity, psychiatric comorbidity, medications, adherence, and side effects. Results: With controls for baseline case mix and time-variant medication characteristics, the TBCC group reported significantly fewer side effects at six and 12 months (p=.008 and .002, respectively). The number of antidepressants prescribed increased risk of side effects (p=.02). Conclusions: Patients in the TBCC group reported fewer antidepressant-related side effects, which may have contributed to improved quality of life.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:28","2018-12-21 18:01:28","","272-278","","3","66","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that treatment non-response in routine clinical practice is often due to failures in the delivery of treatment, and that most patients who are apparently treatment-resistant will respond to treatment if adequately delivered. DesignRetrospective cohort data analysis. MethodsForty-three young people with severe, treatment-resistant OCD (defined as Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [CY-BOCS] scores 30 and non-response to previous cognitive behaviour therapy [CBT] and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) were referred to a specialist clinic and completed a course of manualized CBT, with (N=21) or without (N=22) optimization of medication. A sub-sample (N=15) completed a semi-structured interview to determine characteristics of their previous CBT; quality was assessed according to pre-determined criteria. ResultsSpecialist treatment was associated with significant reductions in OCD symptoms at post-treatment with gains maintained at 3-month follow-up. At the 3-month follow-up, 58% of patients showed a meaningful clinical response (35% drop on the CY-BOCS) and 22% were in remission (12 on the CY-BOCS). Patients whose medication was optimized tended (non-significantly) to have better responses. The quality of previous CBT was assessed in a sub-group of participants and rated as inadequate in 95.5% of cases. The most common inadequacy was insufficient focus on exposure techniques. ConclusionsThese findings provide support for the notion that treatment non-response in routine practice may be due to technical treatment failures and highlight the need to disseminate good quality evidence-based treatment among this population. Research is also needed to understand factors that impede outcome to further improve response and remission rates. Practitioner points Among young people with OCD, failure to respond to treatment in routine clinical practice may often reflect the nature of the treatment received. Exposure techniques may often be overlooked in CBT for OCD, potentially resulting in poor therapeutic response. Most young people with severe and apparent treatment-resistant OCD respond to outpatient CBT incorporating E/RP. Further research is needed to establish effective methods for disseminating good quality CBT for OCD.","2015-03","2018-12-21 18:01:29","2018-12-21 18:01:29","","63-75","","1","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive behaviour therapy; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; paediatric; treatment-resistant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Experiment 1, even when a company's hiring decisions disadvantaged women, women perceived the company as more procedurally just for women and were less supportive of sexism litigation when the company offered diversity training, compared to when it did not. In Experiment 2, women perceived a company as more procedurally just for women and as less likely to have engaged in sexism when the company offered diversity training, compared to when it did not. This effect was not moderated by women's endorsement of status legitimizing beliefs. In Experiment 3, women perceived a company as more procedurally just and less discriminatory when the company had been recognized for positive gender diversity practices compared to when it had not. Additionally, these effects were most pronounced among women who endorsed benevolent sexist beliefs and mitigated among those who rejected benevolent sexist beliefs.

Individuals are thought to need belief in a just world (BJW) in part because it gives them the confidence required to invest in long-term goals. However, BJW can only provide confidence that individuals will reap the rewards of their investments if they invest in their goals through prosocial means (e.g., Hafer, 2000). The current study provides evidence for this argument. Specifically, we examined individual differences in BJW, long-term goal focus, and prosocial-antisocial tendencies to test the hypothesis that higher long-term focus would be associated with higher BJW, but only amongst those who are also high in prosocial (low in antisocial) tendencies. This hypothesis was tested four times using four measures of prosocial-antisocial tendencies. Simple slopes analyses revealed the predicted pattern of results for three of the four measures. Our findings (a) provide novel support for the idea that BJW aids in the prosocial pursuit of long-term goals, and (b) have implications for individual variation in BJW. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Within this population, sexual risk behaviors have been associated with increased impulsivity. Studies in non-clinical populations showing gender-related differences in sexual decision-making and casual sexual partnering suggest impulsivity has a greater influence on men than women, but these differences have not been documented in substance-using patients. In a sample of 89 adults with recent cocaine use and receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment, we tested the hypothesis that gender moderates the effect of impulsivity on sexual risk-taking. Using logistic regression modeling, we tested the main and gender-moderated effects of task-related impulsivity on the probability of having a casual sexual partner and multiple sexual partners. Results confirmed a significant gender-by-impulsivity interaction; men who were more impulsive on a continuous performance task had significantly higher rates of sexual risk-taking than less impulsive men, but women's impulsivity was unrelated to these outcomes. Impulsive men were over three times as likely as less impulsive men to have a recent casual partner. Implications of these results and suggestions for future research are discussed.

We also tested the association between childhood cognition and later BP. Methods: A population-based birth cohort derived from the Child Health and Development Study (CHDS) which included nearly all pregnant women receiving obstetric care horn the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan, Northern California Region (KPNC) between 1959 and 1966. Prospectively obtained medical and offspring cognitive performance were used Potential cases with BP from the cohort were identified by database linkages. This protocol identified 94 cases who were matched 1:8 to controls. Results: Perinatal oxytocin was associated with a 24 times increased odds of later BP. Oxytocin was also associated with decreased performance on the Raven Matrices, but not on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). Childhood cognition was not associated with later BP. Limitations: Loss to follow-up must be considered in all birth cohort studies. In addition, the childhood cognitive battery did not include tests related to multiple domains of cognition which have been associated with later BR A third limitation is the modest sample size of those exposed to oxytocin. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for a potentially important perinatal risk factor for BP and cognitive impairment in childhood. While the association between perinatal oxytocin and offspring BP must be viewed cautiously until further studies can attempt to replicate the result, it lends support to the broader view that neurodevelopmental factors contribute to BP.

In prior studies, phobic participants approached a live tarantula immediately after the masked stimuli were presented. This study tested the hypothesis that VBE would reduce phobic avoidance of the tarantula 24 h later. Method: 86 spider-phobic participants were identified with a fear questionnaire and Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT) with a live tarantula indicative of a DSM-IV diagnosis of Specific Phobia. One week later, they were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to presentation of a continuous series of 25 trials of masked images of either spiders or flowers (33-ms each), i.e., to VBE or control exposure. The participants gave subjective distress ratings just before and after these exposures. Then they engaged in the BAT again either immediately thereafter or 24 h later to measure changes in avoidance of the tarantula. Results: Masked images of spiders reduced avoidance of the tarantula both immediately after exposure and 24 h later without causing subjective distress. The effect sizes at these two time points did not significantly differ from each other. Limitations: We did not manipulate awareness of the spider images by presenting them unmasked to a third group. Conclusions about the effect of awareness of the stimuli cannot be drawn.

Using a passive conditioning task and fMRI in a group of experienced mindfulness meditators and agematched controls, we tested the hypothesis that mindfulness meditation influence reward and reward prediction error (PE) signals. We found diminished positive and negative PErelated blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the putamen in meditators compared with controls. In the meditator group this decrease in striatal BOLD responses to reward PE was paralleled by increased activity in posterior insula, a primary interoceptive region. Critically, responses in the putamen during early trials of the conditioning procedure (run 1) were elevated in both meditators and controls. Overall, these results provide evidence that experienced mindfulness meditators are able to attenuate reward prediction signals to valenced stimuli, which may be related to interoceptive processes encoded in the posterior insula.","2015-02-12","2018-12-21 18:01:35","2018-12-21 18:01:35","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","classical; conditioning; fMRI BOLD; interoceptive awareness; mindfulness; reward processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that some children are more susceptible to school-entry educational interventions than their peers due to their genetic makeup, and thus whether the dopamine receptor D4 gene moderated intervention effects. Children were randomly assigned to a control condition or one of two interventions involving computer programs tailored to the literacy needs of delayed pupils: Living Letters for alphabetic knowledge and Living Books for text comprehension. Effects of Living Books met the criteria of differential susceptibility. For carriers of the dopamine receptor D4 gene seven-repeat allele (about one-third of the delayed group), the Living Books program was an important addition to the common core curriculum in kindergarten (effect size d = 0.56), whereas the program did not affect the other children (d = -0.09). The same seven-repeat carriers benefited more from Living Letters than did the noncarriers, as reflected in effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.34, respectively, although such differences did not fulfill the statistical criteria for differential susceptibility.

Increased genomic instability has been observed in other heritable paediatric neurobiological disorders; therefore, the aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that DNA damage is increased in children with autism and that B vitamin status may explain variations in genome integrity between autistic and normal children. We compared 35 children with autism, 27 of their siblings without autism and 25 age- and gender-matched community controls for genomic stability using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay, B vitamins and homocysteine, as well as autism-related behaviours. It was found that there were no differences in CBMN-cyt biomarkers between the three groups. Vitamin B2 was significantly raised in children with autism and their siblings compared with controls (P=0.027 and P=0.016 respectively) but there was no difference in other B vitamins or homocysteine. In conclusion, although replication using a larger cohort is needed, it appears unlikely that genomic instability is a feature of the aetiology of autism.

Some studies have answered this question in the positive, others in the negative. We tested the hypothesis that annular deployment depends on the presence of a suitable structural framework to which attention can be anchored. To this end, we added a structural framework to the displays of a study that failed to find an annular distribution of attention. The targets were displayed in an annular region around a central stream of task-irrelevant distractors which captured attention and impaired target identification. This design was replicated in our No-Anchors condition. In the Anchors condition in Experiments 1 and 2, a square outline was displayed at each of the four possible target locations. Consistent with the idea that attention can be deployed as an annulus only when a visual framework is present, the targets were identified more accurately (Experiment 1) and more rapidly (Experiment 2) when anchors were present than when they were absent. The number of anchors was increased to eight in Experiment 3. In Experiment 4 the central stream was omitted to verify that the enhanced performance did not arise from intrinsic properties of the anchors themselves. In Experiment 5, targets were presented in a blank annular region delimited by two concentric circles, thus obviating the possibility that attention was deployed as four or eight separate foci in Experiments 2 and 3, respectively.","2015-02","2018-12-21 18:01:38","2018-12-21 18:01:38","","413-422","","2","77","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Attention: selective; Attention: space-based; Attentional blink","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Earlier, we showed that when human participants were permitted to respond for a reward in the presence of a task-irrelevant, reward-predicting stimulus (i.e. goCS+ trials), the CS+ provoked an action tendency to respond compared to when a non-rewarding CS- stimulus was present (i.e. goCS- trials). However, when participants were not permitted to respond, response suppression was recruited to mitigate the action tendency that was triggered by the motivating CS+ stimulus (i.e. on nogoCS+ trials) (Freeman et al., 2014). Here we tested the hypothesis that repeated response suppression over a motivationally-triggered action tendency would reduce subsequent CS+ provocation. We compared groups of participants who had different proportions of nogoCS+ trials, and we measured CS+ provocation on go trials via reaction time. Our results showed that CS+ provocation on go trials was reduced monotonically as the proportion of nogoCS+ trials increased. Further analysis showed that these group differences were best explained by reduced provocation on goCS+ trials that followed nogoCS+ (compared to nogoCS-) trials. Follow-up experiments using a neurophysiological index of motor activity replicated these effects and also suggested that, following nogoCS+ trials, a response suppression mechanism was in place to help prevent subsequent CS+ provocation. Thus, our results show that performing response suppression in the face of a motivating stimulus not only controls responding at that time, but also prevents provocation in the near future.

The current study builds on these 2 literatures to test the hypothesis that failure to modulate DMN activity in ADHD might be especially pronounced at ER extremes.

Task-related DMN deactivations were compared between 2 groups. There was a differential effect of ER on DMN activity for individuals with ADHD compared to controls. Individuals with ADHD displayed excessive DMN activity at the fast and slow, but not at the moderate ER.

This study tested the hypothesis that improvements in family functioning and reductions in caregiver strain explained the effects of parental psychopathology on youth treatment outcome in an anxiety treatment trial. Method: A multiple mediation technique was used to test the proposed model across independent evaluator (IE), parent, and youth informants in 488 youths, aged 7-17 years (50% female; mean age = 10.7) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for social phobia, separation anxiety, and/or generalized anxiety disorder.

At pre- and posttreatment, parents completed self-report measures of global psychopathology symptoms, family functioning, and caregiver strain; parents, youths, and IEs rated youths' anxiety symptom severity. Results: Changes in family functioning and caregiver strain jointly explained relations between parental psychopathology and reductions in youth anxiety. Specifically, across IE and parent informants, families with higher pretreatment parental psychopathology showed more improvement in family functioning and caregiver strain, which in turn predicted greater youth anxiety reductions. Further, higher pretreatment parental psychopathology predicted greater caregiver strain reductions and, in turn, greater youth anxiety reductions, based on youths' reports of their own anxiety.

Parental modeling of fearful or avoidant behavior is believed to contribute to this association. We employed a novel motion-tracking experimentation platform to test the hypothesis that mothers' behavioral avoidance of spiders moderates the association between fear of spiders in mothers and children. MethodParticipants were 86 children (aged 7-17) presenting with an anxiety disorder, and their mothers. Children and mothers completed the Spider Phobia Questionnaire. Mothers completed a motion-tracking assessment of behavioral avoidance of spiders. ResultsFear of spiders in mothers was associated with fear of spiders in children (r(85)=0.48, 95%CI 0.30 - 0.63, P<0.001). Two metrics of behavioral avoidance in mothers were associated with mothers' self-reported fear of spiders (r=-0.49, 95% CI 0.31-0.64, P<0.001; and r=0.42, 95%CI 0.23 - 0.58 P<0.001). Mothers' behavioral avoidance moderated the association between fear of spiders in mothers and in children. When mothers' avoidance was intermediate or high the association was significant, and as mothers' behavioral avoidance increased the strength of the association increased. Fear of spiders in mothers with low behavioral avoidance was not associated with fear of spiders in their children. ConclusionsThe study demonstrates that behavioral avoidance can be measured using the motion-tracking platform and can be useful in understanding the links between symptoms of anxiety in mothers and children. Reducing parents' overt expressions of avoidance may lower the risk of fears being transmitted to children.","2015-02","2018-12-21 18:01:43","2018-12-21 18:01:43","","91-98","","2, SI","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescent; anxiety; anxiety disorders; child; computer; internet technology; maternal child; phobia; phobic disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that stigma may be a mechanism through which obesity negatively affects self-reported health. Two studies examined whether perceived weight-based discrimination and concerns over weight stigma mediated the association between BMI and self-reported psychological health (Study 1) and physical health (Study 2). Method: In 2 online studies, adult community members completed measures of stigma-relevant mediators (perceived weight discrimination, weight stigma concerns) and provided their height and weight. In Study 1 (N = 171) participants also completed measures of psychological health (depression, self-esteem, quality of life), whereas participants in Study 2 (N = 194) also completed a measure of self-reported physical health. Process modeling was used to simultaneously test for mediation through perceived discrimination and stigma concerns independently as well as for serial mediation through both variables. Results: Across both studies, we hypothesized and found support for serial mediation such that BMI was indirectly related to poorer self-reported health through its effect on perceived discrimination and concerns about stigma. Additionally, concerns about stigma mediated the association between BMI and health independent of perceived discrimination.

Over 8 studies, using various thought experiment paradigms, participants reliably ascribed to a physically duplicated being a greater retention of physical than of mental properties. This difference was unrelated to whether or not this being was given a proper name (Study 1b) and was only found for entities that were considered to actually possess a mind (Study 1c). Further, we found that an intuitive belief in mind-body dualism may in fact be considered a default: Taxing participants' cognitive resources (Study 2) or priming them with an intuitive (vs. analytical) thinking style (Studies 3a and 3b) both increased dualistic beliefs. In a last set of studies, we found that beliefs in mind-body dualism are indeed related to essentialistic reasoning about the mind. When a living being was reassembled from its original molecules rather than recreated from new molecules, dualistic beliefs were significantly reduced (Studies 4a and 4b). Thus, results of the present research indicate that, despite any acquired scientific knowledge about the neurological origins of mental life, most adults remain “essentialistic mind-body dualists” at heart.","2015-02","2018-12-21 18:01:45","2018-12-21 18:01:45","","222-235","","1","144","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","common-sense beliefs; essentialism; mind-body dualism; naive theories; thought experiments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the serotonin transporter (5-HTT, SERT) has been scrutinized as an ASD candidate risk gene. SERT plays key roles in the development of circuits that underlie sensory function, particularly in the somatosensory system. One previous study in ASD found association of a rare, hyperfunctional SERT variant with sensory aversion, but studies of common SERT variants have never examined sensory symptoms in ASD. Using standardized caregiver assessments of sensory function in children, we evaluated patterns of sensory responsiveness in 47 children with ASD and 38 typically developing (TD) children. Study participants were genotyped for the functional SERT promoter polymorphisms, 5-HTTLPR and rs25531, to test the hypothesis that the higher expressing genotypes would be associated with hyperresponsiveness to touch, a common sensory aversion in ASD. All measures of sensory hypo- and hyperresponsiveness were increased in children with ASD, with hyporesponsive sensory patterns negatively correlated to age and hyperresponsive sensory patterns positively correlated to repetitive behavior. Strikingly, high-expressing SERT genotypes were associated with increased tactile hyperresponsiveness in the ASD group. Our findings indicate genetic variation that increases SERT function may specifically impact somatosensory processing in ASD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Three studies tested the hypothesis that stronger belief in free will would lead to more counterfactual thinking. Experimental manipulations (Studies 1-2) and a measure (Studies 3-4) of belief in free will were linked to increased counterfactual thinking in response to autobiographical (Studies 1, 3, and 4) and hypothetical (Study 2) events. Belief in free will also predicted the kind of counterfactuals generated. Belief in free will was associated with an increase in the generation of self and upward counterfactuals, which have been shown to be particularly useful for learning.

MethodIn 60 patients, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale. The subjects underwent MRI, 18F-FDG PET imaging, and lumbar CSF extraction. ResultsSubjects with depressive symptoms (n=24) did not have more pathological AD biomarkers than non-depressed. Uncorrected there were trends towards larger hippocampal volumes (P=0.06), less orbital WM damage measured by DTI (P=0.10), and higher orbital glucose metabolism (P=0.02) in the depressed group. The findings were similar when SCI and MCI were analyzed separately. Similarly, in patients with pathological CSF biomarkers (i.e., predementia AD, n=24), we found that correlations between scores on GDS and CSF A ss 42 and P-tau indicated less severe AD-specific CSF changes with increasing depression.

MethodWe interviewed a sample of more than 900 women in late pregnancy. We assessed whether they met criteria for depression on a standardized measure of post-natal depression [the Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale (EPDS)] and met DSM-IV criteria for major depression and/or were in receipt of antidepressant medication. Blood was collected at that time to generate data on nine PUFA variables. Sample members were re-interviewed post-natally to determine depressive experience in the 3months following the birth of their baby. ResultsUnivariate associations were demonstrated between pre-natal depression categorized using DSM criteria and measures of blood fatty acids including total omega-3, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) omega-3 and DHA plus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) omega-3. Such associations were not found post-natally, but different associations were quantified between EPDS-diagnosed depression and total omega-6, total omega-3 and EPA omega-3. In multivariate analyses, slight associations were maintained between EPDS and lower omega-3, lower EPA and higher omega-6 when neuroticism, stress during pregnancy, a lifetime episode of depression and older age were included in the analysis. ConclusionFindings in such a large sample indicate that PUFA status in late pregnancy is only slightly linked with the risk of post-natal depression when depression was quantified by the EPDS. There were no associations between post-natal depression diagnosed by DSM criteria and any fatty acid variables.","2015-02","2018-12-21 18:01:48","2018-12-21 18:01:48","","148-156","","2","131","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","depression; omega-3 fatty acids; post-partum depression; pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A longitudinal, three-wave epidemiologic study was implemented in a sample of individuals aged 55 years and older (n = 4,803) followed up at 2.5 years and 4.5 years. This was a population-based cohort drawn from the Zaragoza Dementia and Depression (ZARADEMP) Project, in Zaragoza, Spain. Participants included individuals cognitively intact at baseline (n = 3,864). The main outcome measures were depression as assessed by using the diagnostic interview Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy package; and AD diagnosed by a panel of research psychiatrists according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria. The Fine and Gray multivariate regression model was used in the analysis, accounting for mortality. Results: At baseline, clinically significant depression was diagnosed in 452 participants (11.7%); of these, 16.4% had severe depression. Seventy incident cases of AD were found at follow-up. Compared with nondepressed individuals, the incidence rate of AD was significantly higher in the severely depressed subjects (incidence rate ratio: 3.59 [95% confidence interval: 1.30-9.94]). A consistent, significant association was observed between severe depression at baseline and incident AD in the multivariate model (hazard ratio: 4.30 [95% CI: 1.39-13.33]). Untreated depression was associated with incident AD in the unadjusted model; however, in the final model, this association was attenuated and nonsignificant. Conclusions: Severe depression increases the risk of AD, even after controlling for the competing risk of death.","2015-02","2018-12-21 18:01:48","2018-12-21 18:01:48","","119-129","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alzheimer's disease; depression; incidence; Risk factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 202 adults registered with inner-city community mental health teams in the United Kingdom completed interviews assessing their engagement with mental health services (service user-rated version of the Service Engagement Scale), discrimination that they experienced because of mental illness, and other variables. Structural equation modeling was conducted to examine the relationship of experienced discrimination and service engagement with potential mediating and moderating variables, such as anticipated discrimination (Questionnaire on Anticipated Discrimination), internalized stigma (Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale), stigma stress appraisal (Stigma Stress Appraisal), mistrust in services, the therapeutic relationship (Scale to Assess Therapeutic Relationships), difficulty disclosing information about one's mental health, and social support. Analyses controlled for age, race-ethnicity, and symptomatology. Results: No evidence was found for a direct effect between experienced discrimination and service engagement. The total indirect effect of experienced discrimination on service engagement was statistically significant (coefficient=1.055, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.312-2.074, p=.019), mainly via mistrust in mental health services and therapeutic relationships (coefficient=.804, CI=.295-1.558, p=.019). A 1-unit increase in experienced discrimination via this pathway resulted in .804-unit of deterioration in service engagement.

Previous findings showed robust PNN decreases in amygdala, entorhinal cortex and prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia (SZ), but not bipolar disorder (BD). These studies were carried out using a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) lectin marker. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the CSPG aggrecan, and 6-sulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS-6) chains highly represented in aggrecan, may contribute to these abnormalities. Antibodies against aggrecan and CS-6 (3B3 and CS56) were used in the amygdala of healthy control, SZ and BD subjects. In controls, aggrecan immunoreactivity (IR) was observed in PNNs and glial cells. Antibody 3B3, but not CS56, also labeled PNNs in the amygdala. In addition, dense clusters of CS56 and 3B3 IR encompassed CS56- and 3B3-IR glia, respectively. In SZ, numbers of aggrecan-and 3B3-IR PNNs were decreased, together with marked reductions of aggrecan-IR glial cells and CS-6 (3B3 and CS56)-IR `clusters'. In BD, numbers of 3B3-IR PNNs and CS56-IR clusters were reduced. Our findings show disruption of multiple PNN populations in the amygdala of SZ and, more modestly, BD. Decreases of aggrecan-IR glia and CS-6-IR glial `clusters', in sharp contrast to increases of CSPG/lectin-positive glia previously observed, indicate that CSPG abnormalities may affect distinct glial cell populations and suggest a potential mechanism for PNN decreases. Together, these abnormalities may contribute to a destabilization of synaptic connectivity and regulation of neuronal functions in the amygdala of subjects with major psychoses.","2015-01-20","2018-12-21 18:01:50","2018-12-21 18:01:50","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over-reliance on it leads to problematic use, which studies show can be predicted by psychological distress. Self-determination theory proposes that we all have the basic need for autonomy, competency, and relatedness. This has been shown to explain the motivations behind problematic Internet use. This study hypothesizes that individuals who are psychologically disturbed because their basic needs are not being met are more vulnerable to becoming reliant on the Internet when they seek such needs satisfaction from online activities, and tests a model in which basic needs predict problematic Internet use, fully mediated by psychological distress. Problematic Internet use, psychological distress, and basic needs satisfaction were psychometrically measured in a sample of 229 Hong Kong University students and structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. All indices showed the model has a good fit. Further, statistical testing supported a mediation effect for psychological distress between needs satisfaction and problematic Internet use.The results extend our understanding of the development and prevention of problematic Internet use based on the framework of self-determination theory. Psychological distress could be used as an early predictor, while preventing and treating problematic Internet use should emphasize the fulfillment of unmet needs.","2015-01-14","2018-12-21 18:01:50","2018-12-21 18:01:50","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","need satisfaction; problematic Internet use; psychological distress; self-determination theory; structural equation modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on studies suggesting that the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) is associated with regulation of negative emotions, the present experiment tests the hypothesis that decreasing the cortical excitability of the rVLPFC may increase negative emotional reactions to social exclusion. Specifically, we applied cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the rVLPFC and predicted an increment of negative emotional reactions to social exclusion. In Study 1, participants were either socially excluded or included, while cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation was applied over the rVLPFC. Cathodal stimulation of rVLPFC boosted the typical negative emotional reaction caused by social exclusion. No effects emerged from participants in the inclusion condition. To test the specificity of tDCS effects over rVLPFC, in Study 2, participants were socially excluded and received cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation over a control region (i.e., the right posterior parietal cortex). No effects of tDCS stimulation were found.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy has been found to reduce levels of stress and distress and to improve QoL. This pilot study in people with psoriasis aimed to test the hypothesis that mindfulness could reduce stress and thereby lessen psoriasis severity, improve QoL and reduce distress. Twenty-nine people with psoriasis (22-70-years old; 16 females; 13 males) were randomised to an eight-week mindfulness treatment as an adjunct to their usual psoriasis therapy or to a control group which continued with usual psoriasis therapy alone. All subjects completed self-reported measurements of psoriasis severity, perceived stress, distress and QoL, at baseline and again post-intervention. The mindfulness group reported statistically lower psoriasis severity (Self-Assessed Psoriasis Area Severity Index; z = 1.96, p = .05) and QoL impairment scores (Dermatology Life Quality Index; z = 2.30, p = .02) than the control group. There was no significant difference between groups on perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale; z = .07, p = .94) or distress scores (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale; z = 1.60, p = .11). People with psoriasis who received mindfulness as an adjunct to their usual therapy reported a significant improvement in both psoriasis severity and QoL.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that individuals with ET would exhibit worse performance on memory tasks requiring more intrinsic organization and structuring (i.e., word lists) relative to those with fewer `executive' demands (i.e., stories), similar to that previously observed in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Method: Participants included a convenience sample of 68 ET patients and 68 idiopathic PD patients, retrospectively matched based on age, education, and sex. All patients underwent routine neuropsychological evaluation assessing recent memory, auditory attention/working memory, language, and executive function. Memory measures included the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-R and WMS-III Logical Memory. Results: Both ET and PD patients performed significantly worse on word list than story memory recall tasks. The magnitude of the difference between these two memory tasks was similar for ET and PD patients. In both patient groups, performance on measures of executive function and auditory attention/working memory was not distinctly correlated with word list vs. story recall. Conclusions: These findings suggest that frontal-executive dysfunction in both ET and PD may negatively influence performance on memory tests that are not inherently organized. Although the pathophysiology of these two `movement disorders' are quite distinct, both have downstream effects on thalamo-frontal circuitry which may provide a common pathway for a similar memory phenotype.

Allocation of resources often is not congruent with assessed needs. A series of cost-congruence hypotheses was developed to test assumptions that needs are associated with resources provided for appropriate services in homeless populations. Methods: Individuals (N=255) who were homeless were followed for two years and were categorized by housing status over time (consistently housed, housed late, lost housing, or consistently homeless). Detailed information about the individuals was obtained at baseline, and follow-up data were collected one and two years later. Extensive data about the costs of services provided by type (medical, psychiatric, substance abuse, and homeless maintenance and amelioration) were derived from 23 agencies, and service use information was collected from the agencies and by self-report. Multiple regression models were used to test the hypotheses. Results: Medical, psychiatric, and homeless maintenance costs varied by housing status. Serious mental illness predicted costs for psychiatric services, as expected, but also costs for substance abuse services and acute behavioral health care and total costs. Alcohol use disorders predicted substance abuse service costs.

A Test of the Effect of Negative Appraisals across Thought Types","JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY","","2043-8087","10.5127/jep.041314","","Cognitive-behavioral and metacognitive theories propose that negative interpretations of normal intrusive or repetitive negative thoughts lead to symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, most research has been correlational and has examined only obsessional thoughts, despite similarities between theoretical models of obsessions and models of worry and rumination. In the present study, healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive negative, normalizing, or no feedback about their worried, ruminative, and obsessional thoughts to test the hypothesis that negative thought appraisals predict increased negative outcomes across thought types. Additional analyses determined whether preexisting beliefs about thoughts predicted outcomes, either alone or in interaction with experimental condition. Preexisting beliefs interacted with experimental condition to predict affective responses, with negative feedback having the expected effect only for individuals with preexisting negative beliefs about thoughts. Overall, results are consistent with a transdiagnostic model in which preexisting negative beliefs about thoughts act as a cognitive vulnerability in the face of specific, relevant environmental stressors.

However, there has been limited research elucidating the mechanisms through which this occurs. This study tested the hypothesis that BPD-specific cognitive distortions, particularly under cognitive load, account for the relationship between severity of BPD features and self-reported difficulties with goal-directed behavior when upset. In a sample of undergraduates (n = 187) oversampled for high levels of BPD features, we employed a timed task (unscrambling word strings to create meaningful sentences) to assess BPD-specific cognitive distortions. Severity of BPD features was significantly correlated with the tendency to create BPD-specific sentences, and this relationship was stronger when the task was completed under a cognitive load. Mediational models using bootstrapping suggested that the relationship between BPD features and perceived difficulties with goal-directed behavior when upset may be a result of increases in cognitive distortions under cognitive load. These results offer multi-method evidence for the importance of BPD-related cognitive distortions in accounting for the difficulties in goal pursuit associated with BPD features.

The results demonstrated that pitch gestures enhanced English speakers' discrimination between the meanings of Mandarin words differing in tone, whereas semantic gestures hindered their identification of tones in learned words. These findings indicate that the visuospatial features of pitch gestures strengthen the relationship between English speakers' representations of Mandarin lexical tones and word meanings, supporting the predictions of spoken word recognition and embodied cognition.","2015","2018-12-21 18:01:58","2018-12-21 18:01:58","","347-353","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","embodied cognition; gesture; lexical tone; second language acquisition; spoken word recognition; word learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increased ingestion of food containing sugar and fat ingredients (comfort food) is proposed to “compensate” chronic stress effects. However, this eating habit may increase body fat depositions leading to obesity. This study evaluated behavioral/physiological parameters seeking to establish whether there is an association between the effects of HD intake and stress, and to test the hypothesis that the development of anxious behavior and obesity during chronic stress periods depends on the type of diet. Sixty-day-old male Wistar rats (n = 100) were divided into four groups: standard chow, hypercaloric diet, chronic stress/standard chow and chronic stress/hypercaloric diet. Chronic stress was induced by restraint stress exposure for 1 h/day, for 80 d. At the end of this period, rat behavior was evaluated using open-field and plus-maze tests. The results showed that HD alone increased weight gain and adipose deposition in subcutaneous and mesenteric areas. However, stress reduced weight gain and adipose tissue in these areas. HD also increased naso-anal length and concurrent stress prevented this. Behavioral data indicated that stress increased anxiety-like behaviors and comfort food reduced these anxiogenic effects; locomotor activity increased in rats fed with HD. Furthermore, HD decreased corticosterone levels and stress increased adrenal weight. The data indicate that when rats are given HD and experience chronic stress this association reduces the pro-obesogenic effects of HD, and decreases adrenocortical activity.","2015","2018-12-21 18:01:59","2018-12-21 18:01:59","","514-523","","5","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anxiety-like; chronic stress; elevated plus-maze test; hypercaloric diet; obesity; open-field test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the hypothesis that chronic sugar intake exacerbates metabolic deficits induced by early-life stress. Early-life stress was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using limited nesting material in early lactation (LN, postnatal days 2-9), and siblings were given chow alone or with additional sucrose post weaning (n = 9-17 per group). Female control and LN siblings had unlimited access to either chow plus water, or chow and water plus 25% sucrose solution (Sucrose), from 3-15 weeks of age. Weekly body weight and food intake were measured. Glucose and insulin tolerance were tested at 13 and 14 weeks of age, respectively. Rats were killed at 15 weeks. Hepatic triglyceride and markers of lipid synthesis - fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha and oxidation - and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Pgc-1 alpha) were examined. Mediators of hepatic glucocorticoid metabolism, specifically 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11 beta HSD-1), 5-alpha reductase, and glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNAs were also measured. Sucrose increased caloric intake in both groups, but overall energy intake was not altered by LN exposure. LN exposure had no further impact on sucrose-induced glucose intolerance and increased plasma and liver triglycerides. Hepatic markers of fat synthesis and oxidation were concomitantly activated and 11 beta HSD-1 mRNA expression was increased by 53% in LN-Sucrose versus Con-Sucrose rats. Adiposity was increased by 26% in LN-Sucrose versus Con-Sucrose rats. Thus, LN exposure had minimal adverse metabolic effects despite high-sugar diet postweaning.","2015","2018-12-21 18:02:00","2018-12-21 18:02:00","","524-537","","5","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; early-life stress; glucose/insulin tolerance; hepatic triglyceride; limited nesting; sucrose","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the authors investigated the roles of coworker support and individual characteristics, i.e., exchange ideology and learning orientation on knowledge sharing. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from questionnaires distributed to employees and their direct supervisors in two companies in South Korea. Hierarchical regression analyses and simple slope test were performed to test the hypotheses. Findings - Coworker support and learning orientation is positively but exchange ideology is negatively related to knowledge sharing. Furthermore, when coworker support is low, knowledge sharing is mainly dependent on each individual's characteristics. However, when coworker support is high, employees showed high level of knowledge sharing irrespective of their individual characteristics. Research limitations/implications - This study suggested that the support from coworker as well as individuals' characteristics plays an important role in determining their knowledge sharing behaviors. Moreover, the authors found the significant interaction effects of coworker support and individual characteristics on knowledge sharing, drawing on insights from trait activation theory. Practical implications - For organizations to encourage individual knowledge sharing behaviors, they may need to maintain the work environment that encourages the peer workers to support each other. Originality/value - Although many actions have been adopted to foster knowledge management in organizations, employees may still be reluctant to share their knowledge.

Based on a survey of published experimental materials, the present article will demonstrate that both the restricted (a) and the generalized (b) hypotheses are false when the ISIB effect is evaluated in terms of absolute intelligibility scores. We will then propose a simple way to compute a relative measure for the ISIB (R-ISIB), which we claim is a more insightful way of evaluating the interlanguage benefit, and test the hypotheses in relative (R-ISIB) terms on the same literature data. We then find that our R-ISIB measure only supports the more restricted hypothesis (a) while rejecting the more general hypothesis (b). This finding shows that the native language shared by the interactants biases the listener toward interpreting sounds in terms of the phonology of the shared mother tongue.","2015","2018-12-21 18:02:02","2018-12-21 18:02:02","","","","6","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit; linear modeling; matched interlanguage; non-matched interlanguage; Nonnative speech perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linear regression was used to test the hypotheses. Results: As hypothesized, there was a positive relation between pathways and acquired capability. Contrary to our hypotheses, after controlling for gender there was a significant relation between agency and acquired capability. In addition, after controlling for gender, pathways did not moderate the relation between painful and provocative events and acquired capability, whereas agency did moderate this relation.

They induce cues to flatness, indicating that images are presented on a unique surface and specifying the relative depth of that surface. The center of interest of this study is on a second problem, arising when a 3D object distance differs from the display distance. As binocular disparity must be scaled using an estimate of viewing distance, object depth can thus be affected through disparity scaling. Two previous experiments revealed that stereoscopic displays can affect depth perception due to conflicting accommodation and vergence cues at near distances. In this study, depth perception is evaluated for farther accommodation and vergence distances using a commercially available 3D TV. In Experiment I, we evaluated depth perception of 3D stimuli at different vergence distances for a large pool of participants. We observed a strong effect of vergence distance that was bigger for younger than for older participants, suggesting that the effect of accommodation was reduced in participants with emerging presbyopia. In Experiment 2, we extended 3D estimations by varying both the accommodation and vergence distances. We also tested the hypothesis that setting accommodation open loop by constricting pupil size could decrease the contribution of focus cues to perceived distance. We found that the depth constancy was affected by accommodation and vergence distances and that the accommodation distance effect was reduced with a larger depth-of-focus. We discuss these results with regard to the effectiveness of focus cues as a distance signal. Overall, these results highlight the importance of appropriate focus cues in stereoscopic displays at intermediate viewing distances.","2015","2018-12-21 18:02:06","2018-12-21 18:02:06","","613-627","","6","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","3D; accommodation; blur; depth perception; focus; stereoscopic displays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Integrating the literature on LMX theory and resource theories, the authors hypothesized that the positive relationship between LMX and employee job performance is sequentially mediated by job resources (autonomy, developmental opportunities, and social support) and employee work engagement. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 847 Dutch police officers filled out an online questionnaire. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships and to account for the nesting of employees in teams. Findings - Employees in high-quality LMX relationships work in a more resourceful work environment (i.e. report more developmental opportunities and social support, but not more autonomy). This resourceful work environment, in turn, facilitates work engagement and job performance. Research limitations/implications - Because of the research design, it is difficult to draw conclusions about causality. Future research may test the newly proposed relationship using a longitudinal or daily diary design.

Findings - Results supported the aggregation of individuals' measure of engagement to form three norms within an organization: an employee norm, a manager norm and a senior leader norm. These engagement norms were significantly related to an individual's engagement at work beyond the effect of both organizational resources and manager support. Individuals were more strongly influenced by the norm of those in the organization with whom they were most similar and with whom they were likely to interact. Originality/value - Provides evidence that engagement exists at the group level and that status groups within the organization have norms that independently affect individual-level engagement.","2015","2018-12-21 18:02:09","2018-12-21 18:02:09","","847-860","","7","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Engagement; Group norms; Multi-level analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To respect property, people need to remember who owns which objects. We test the hypothesis that people possess enhanced memory for ownership relations compared to unrelated objects. Participants viewed a sequence of 10 person-object pairs before completing a surprise associative memory test in which they matched each person with the previously paired object. We varied the description of the person-object pairs in the instructions. Across three experiments, participants showed better recall when the person was described as the owner of the object compared to being unrelated. Furthermore, memory for property was better than a physical relation (bumping), whereas it did not differ from mental relations (wanting and thinking).

Here we test the hypothesis that an illusion can be predicted if the framework containing the target and the darkest background carries more weight in lightness computations. We tested two displays, one with a general white and one with a general black background. An illusion was obtained only in the first display. These results suggest that an illusion can occur with double increment displays when the global value of the targets differs from their local value, as these conditions allow different local framework weighting to affect the targets' final lightness.

Specifically, the relevance of Psychological Capital (PsyCap et al., 2007), composed of the positive psychological resources of hope, efficacy, resilience and optimism, is conceptualized and tested in Egypt in relation to job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach - A contextualized theoretical model is derived, in which PsyCap can lead to job satisfaction through a set of positive mechanisms. Structural equation modeling is used to test the hypothesized relationships on a sample of 451 Egyptian employees in 11 organizations representing some of Egypt's most important industries in terms of GDP, employment and world economy integration. Findings - Hope, efficacy, resilience and optimism, individually and when integrated into the higher-order multidimensional construct, PsyCap, are positively related to the job satisfaction of Egyptian employees. Research limitations/implications - This paper supports the external validity of hope, efficacy, resilience and optimism, individually and when integrated into the higher-order multidimensional construct, PsyCap, in the African and Egyptian context. Practical implications - Egyptian organizations, as well as global companies that conduct business operations in Africa, may find PsyCap to be a new potential source of human-based competitive advantage. PsyCap is state-like and thus open to development through workplace interventions . Originality/value - This study provides evidence for the first time for the external and construct validity of PsyCap in North Africa. Zoogah (2008) found a dearth of articles that focus on North Africa, specifically the Arabian heritage. This paper begins to fill this gap.

Despite this persistently strong association, the construct of hopelessness in terms of its factorial structure and correlates has not been explored among Nigerian psychiatric outpatients. Objective: The aim of this present study is to examine the psychometric characteristics of the Yoruba language culturally adapted version of the Beck Hopelessness Scale in a cross-sectional sample of psychiatric outpatients in South-western Nigeria. Method: The participants were 327 Nigerian adult outpatients receiving treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders, consecutively recruited from the outpatient psychiatric clinics of a university teaching hospital in South-western Nigeria. The outpatients were recruited over a one year period. They completed the Yoruba translated version of the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS-Y), a sociodemographic and illness-related questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Their level of functioning was assessed with the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), psychopathology was evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the level of disability measured with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WIODAS-II). Suicidality and confirmation of the diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders were evaluated with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The construct of hopelessness in terms of factorial structure, reliability, validity and correlates was explored. Exploratory Factor Analysis using Principal Component Analysis with Varimax rotation was used to examine the factorial structure of the BHS-Y. Internal consistency was examined with Cronbach's alpha, and the construct validity of the scale was assessed using correlational analyses with the MINI suicidality module, BDI-II, GAF and WHODAS-II domain scores. We also tested the hypothesis that a shortened version of the BHS-Y will possess psychometric properties similar to the 20 item version. Results: Exploratory Factor Analysis using Principal Component Analysis with Varimax rotation showed that the construct of hopelessness among our outpatients was best explained by a 3 factor model. Reliability of the translated version of the scale was adequate as indicated by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.92. Construct validity was also satisfactory as reflected by the strong correlations with MINI suicidality, Beck Depression Inventory-II and Global Assessment of Functioning scores. The shortened 4 item single factor BHS-Y composed of items 8, 9, 13 and 15 demonstrated psychometric properties similar to those of the full item version. Conclusion: The Beck Hopelessness Scale (Yoruba Version) demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity and therefore may be useful in measuring the construct of hopelessness and in clinical suicide risk assessments among Nigerian psychiatric outpatients. There is the need for more studies to further explore the psychometric features and correlates of this scale among other Nigerian ethnic groups in addition to other medical patients' populations.

In both studies, participants were told either that the target female would choose her date (intersexual) or that male suitors would nominate one another (intrasexual). Under the intersexual selection condition, men demonstrated increased creativity levels and decreased aggression levels, whereas the opposite pattern was observed under the intrasexual selection condition. Study 3 showed that individual differences in creativity and aggression as personality traits similarly predicted intrasexual and intersexual mating strategies, respectively.

Method: 148 female participants were asked to recall their most distressing unwanted sexual experiences. Indices of mental contamination and cognitive appraisals of the experience were then assessed. Results: Our findings indicated that individuals recalling experiences related to rape felt more intense feelings of dirtiness than individuals recalling other types of unwanted sexual experience, such as verbal sexual assault, visual sexual assault, and forcible touching/frottage. In addition, hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that a cognitive appraisal of perceived violation predicted all of the indices of mental contamination after controlling anxiety, depression, and fear of contact contamination.

These regularities in the lexicon enable learners to generalize new words appropriately. How does the lexicon come to have these helpful regularities? We test the hypothesis that systematic backgrounding of some dimensions during learning and use causes language to gradually change, over repeated episodes of transmission, to produce a lexicon with strong patterns of underspecification across these less salient dimensions.

Materials and methods: This is a cross-sectional multisite study conducted on a sample of 516 people with MDD in 19 European countries. Structural Equation Models were developed to examine the direct and indirect effects of self-stigma and social capital on empowerment. Results: Social capital and self-stigma accounted for 56% of the variability in empowerment. Higher social capital was related to lower self-stigma (r = -0.72, P < 0.001) which, in turn, partially mediated the relationship between social capital and empowerment (r = 0.38, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Social capital plays a key role in the appraisal of empowerment, both directly and through the indirect effect mediated by self-stigma. In order to improve empowerment of people with MDD, we identify strategies to foster individual social capital, and to overcome the negative consequences related to self-stigma for attainment of life goals.

Healthy individuals reporting PLEs have a similar personality profile to people with psychosis; however, the mechanisms by which personality influences PLEs are unclear. This study tests the hypothesis that cognitive biases mediate the relationship between two dimensions of personality (i.e. temperament and character) and positive and negative PLEs. Two hundred and ninety-six healthy participants were assessed using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences scale, the Temperament and Character Inventory and the Davos Scale for Cognitive Biases. We performed multiple stepwise regression analysis and mediation analysis according to Baron and Kenny's method. Harm-avoidance and self-directedness personality dimensions significantly predicted PLEs frequency: High self-transcendence and lower cooperativeness predicted positive PLEs. Cognitive biases were significant mediators in relationships between temperament, character and both positive and negative PLEs. In particular, attention to threat and external attribution biases fully mediate the relationship between cooperativeness and positive PLEs. Other cognitive biases partially mediate the relationships between self-transcendence and positive PLEs and self-directedness, harm-avoidance and negative PLEs. Our study tentatively suggests that personality may influence PLEs via the cognitive bias pathway. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Temperaments are conceptualized as trait sub-syndromic conditions of major pathologies. This study set out to test the hypothesis of a continuum between schizotypy and affective temperaments versus the alternative hypothesis of their independence based on a cross-sectional, survey design involving 649 (males: 47%) college students. The short 39-item TEMPS-A and the SPQ were used as measures of the affective temperaments and of schizotypy, respectively. Confirmatory factor analyses were applied to a unidimensional model, to a standard correlate traits model, to second-order representations of a common latent structure, and to a bifactor model.

The current experiment tested the hypothesis that self-affirmation reduces physiological responses to a form of ego threat-interpersonal evaluation. Participants wrote an essay and received either neutral or insulting evaluative feedback about their essay, ostensibly from another participant. Then participants wrote about a core personal value (self-affirmation) or about a less important value (no self-affirmation). Lastly, participants played a competitive reaction time game that permitted them to blast their purported evaluator with noise. Noise blasts did not vary across conditions, but mean arterial blood pressure increased in response to being evaluated and returned to baseline more quickly following self-affirmation. Further, insulting (versus neutral) evaluative feedback caused a greater increase in heart rate, except among those who self-affirmed following the evaluation manipulation. These results suggest that self-affirmation facilitates the return to baseline cardiovascular activity following interpersonal evaluation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Congenital amusia is a neurogenetic disorder that appears to affect primarily pitch and melody perception. Pitch is normally conveyed by the spectro-temporal fine structure of low harmonics, but some pitch information is available in the temporal envelope produced by the interactions of higher harmonics. Using 10 amusic subjects and 10 matched controls, we tested the hypothesis that amusics suffer exclusively from impaired processing of spectro-temporal fine structure. We also tested whether the inability of amusics to process acoustic temporal fine structure extends beyond pitch by measuring sensitivity to interaural time differences, which also rely on temporal fine structure. Further tests were carried out on basic intensity and spectral resolution. As expected, pitch perception based on spectrotemporal fine structure was impaired in amusics; however, no significant deficits were observed in amusics' ability to perceive the pitch conveyed via temporal-envelope cues. Sensitivity to interaural time differences was also not significantly different between the amusic and control groups, ruling out deficits in the peripheral coding of temporal fine structure. Finally, no significant differences in intensity or spectral resolution were found between the amusic and control groups. The results demonstrate a pitch-specific deficit in fine spectro-temporal information processing in amusia that seems unrelated to temporal or spectral coding in the auditory periphery. These results are consistent with the view that there are distinct mechanisms dedicated to processing resolved and unresolved harmonics in the general population, the former being altered in congenital amusia while the latter is spared.

However, little is known about why females report more PTSD symptoms than males. Prior studies have generally focused on few potential mediators at a time and have often used methods that were not ideally suited to test for mediation effects. Prior research has identified a number of individual risk factors that may contribute to sex differences in PTSD severity, although these cannot fully account for the increased symptom levels in females when examined individually. Objective: The present study is the first to systematically test the hypothesis that a combination of pre-, peri-, and posttraumatic risk factors more prevalent in females can account for sex differences in PTSD severity. Method: The study was a quasi-prospective questionnaire survey assessing PTSD and related variables in 73.3% of all Danish bank employees exposed to bank robbery during the period from April 2010 to April 2011. Participants filled out questionnaires 1 week (T-1, N = 450) and 6 months after the robbery (T-2, N = 368; 61.1% females). Mediation was examined using an analysis designed specifically to test a multiple mediator model. Results: Females reported more PTSD symptoms than males and higher levels of neuroticism, depression, physical anxiety sensitivity, peritraumatic fear, horror, and helplessness (the A(2) criterion), tonic immobility, panic, dissociation, negative posttraumatic cognitions about self and the world, and feeling let down. These variables were included in the model as potential mediators. The combination of risk factors significantly mediated the association between sex and PTSD severity, accounting for 83% of the association. Conclusion: The findings suggest that females report more PTSD symptoms because they experience higher levels of associated risk factors. The results are relevant to other trauma populations and to other trauma-related psychiatric disorders more prevalent in females, such as depression and anxiety.","2015","2018-12-21 18:02:26","2018-12-21 18:02:26","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","gender differences; interpersonal violence; multiple mediators; Posttraumatic stress disorder; predictors; risk factors; robbery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that patients with both BD type I (BDI) or II (BDII) and BPD would have a higher rate of SUD than would patients with either disorder alone. A total of 3651 psychiatric patients were evaluated with semistructured diagnostic interviews for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, axis I and II disorders. A total of 63 patients were diagnosed with both BD and BPD, and these patients were significantly more likely to have a SUD compared with BDII patients without BPD (76% vs. 50%, chi(2) = 9.69, p < 0.01).

The associations among early adverse experiences, RF, and attachment security have yet to be examined in adolescence. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether RF moderates the link between early neglect from primary caregivers and insecure attachment in adolescents. Specifically, in this study the authors test the hypothesis that neglect is less strongly associated with insecure attachment among adolescents with high RF. Seventy-nine adolescents (39 male) recruited from a community research center completed the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). Three sets of independent raters scored the AAI for inferred parental neglect, attachment classification, and RF, respectively. The results of a binary logistic regression revealed that RF moderated the association between neglect and attachment: Neglect was only associated with insecure attachment among adolescents with low to moderate RF. The results of the study have the potential to inform our understanding of the evolution of the internal working model of attachment and mentalization during adolescence.","2015-01","2018-12-21 18:02:28","2018-12-21 18:02:28","","23-35","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescence; attachment; mentalization; neglect; resilience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Potential trustees (84 participants from Toulouse, France) made two video clips averaging around 15 seconds for viewing by potential senders before the latter decided whether to `send' or `keep' a lower stake (4 euros) or higher stake (8 euros). Senders (198 participants from Lyon, France) made trust decisions with respect to the recorded clips. If money was sent to the trustee, stakes were tripled and trustees could decide to keep all, two thirds or one half of the tripled stakes. Clips were further rated concerning the genuineness of the displayed smiles. We observe that smiles rated as more genuine strongly predict judgments about the trustworthiness of trustees, and willingness to send them money. We observe a relation between costs and benefits: smiles from trustees playing for higher stakes are rated as significantly more genuine. Finally, we show that those rated as smiling genuinely return more money on average to senders. An increase of one standard deviation in rating of smile genuineness is associated with an unconditional expected gain of about one dollar and thirty cents to senders in the two trials of the experiment. Potential gains for senders could be significantly increased from taking smiles rated as genuine into account. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Furthermore, we predicted that these links follow a process wherein people's perceptions of societal stigma are fully mediated by internalization of that stigma.

Moreover, the intergenerational association in parenting was mediated by later competence in relationships with peers and romantic partners. In particular, sensitive caregiving in infancy and early childhood predicted teachers' rankings of children's social competence with peers during childhood and adolescence, which in turn forecasted later interview ratings of romantic relationship competence during young adulthood, which in turn predicted supportive parenting in adulthood.

This phenomenon is known as inhibition of return (IOR). Previous research has shown that IOR is not observed, or its onset is delayed, in schizophrenia patients. In the present study, the authors tested the hypothesis that IOR may be intact but masked by increased facilitation in schizophrenia patients. To test this hypothesis, they used a procedure that usually reduces or eliminates the early facilitation. Method: In the first experiment, the authors used the typical single-cue IOR task in the group of healthy adults (N = 28) and in a group of schizophrenia patients (N = 32). In the second experiment, they manipulated cue-target discriminability by presenting spatially overlapping cues and targets where the cues were more intense than the targets. Results: In Experiment 1, they did not find significant IOR effects in the group of schizophrenia patients, even with cue-target intervals as long as 3,200 ms. However, in Experiment 2, IOR effects were significant at the 350- and 450-ms cue-target intervals for healthy and patients, respectively. Conclusions: This is the first study that shows that schizophrenia patients can actually show inhibitory effects very similar to healthy controls, even when no help is provided to shift their attention away from the irrelevant location. The authors suggest that inhibition is intact in schizophrenia patients, but it is usually masked by increased facilitation.","2015-01","2018-12-21 18:02:32","2018-12-21 18:02:32","","10-16","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","facilitation; inhibition; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly, the study hypothesizes a sequential direct path between entrepreneurial vocational interests, intentions and nascent behaviors, which in turn would be triggered by the beliefs of self-efficacy and outcome expectations attributed to business start-up at both extrinsic and intrinsic levels. To test the hypotheses of the model, an empirical study carried out with 400 university students within different knowledge areas is described. The results obtained, using the PLS (Partial Least Squares) technique, confirm a positive direct link between entrepreneurial interests, intentions and nascent behaviors, while perceived entrepreneurial self-efficacy predicts such goal sequence. Otherwise, intrinsic outcome expectations are related to vocational interest in business start-up, whereas expected extrinsic rewards do not play any important role in the model.

Preliminary findings suggest that anhedonia is characterized by reduced reward anticipation and motivation of obtaining reward. However, relatively little is known about reward-based decision-making in depression. We tested the hypothesis that anhedonia in MDD may reflect specific impairments in motivation on reward-based decision-making and the deficits might be associated with depressive symptoms severity. In study 1, individuals with and without depressive symptoms performed the modified version of the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), a behavioral measure of cost/benefit decision-making. In study 2, MDD patients, remitted MDD patients and healthy controls were recruited for the same procedures. We found evidence for decreased willingness to make effort for rewards among individuals with subsyndromal depression; the effect was amplified in MDD patients, but dissipated in patients with remitted depression. We also found that reduced anticipatory and consummatory pleasure predicted decreased willingness to expend efforts to obtain rewards in MDD patients. For individuals with subsyndromal depression, the impairments were correlated with anticipatory anhedonia but not consummatory anhedonia. These data offer novel evidence that motivational deficits in MDD are correlated with depression severity and predicted by self-reported anhedonia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study focused on two features (psychopathology and self-esteem) that have received considerable attention in the literature and clinical work, but have rarely been studied simultaneously in detained youths. The aims of this study were to examine gender differences in psychiatric disorders and clusters of self-esteem, and to test the hypothesis that the cluster of adolescents with lower (versus higher) levels of self-esteem have higher rates of psychiatric disorders. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was assessed in 440 Belgian, detained adolescents using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV. Self-esteem was assessed using the Self-perception Profile for Adolescents. Model-based cluster analyses were performed to identify youths with lower and/or higher levels of self-esteem across several domains. Girls have higher rates for most psychiatric disorders and lower levels of self-esteem than boys. A higher number of clusters was identified in boys (four) than girls (three). Generally, the cluster of adolescents with lower (versus higher) levels of self-esteem had a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders. These results suggest that the detection of low levels of self-esteem in adolescents, especially girls, might help clinicians to identify a subgroup of detained adolescents with the highest prevalence of psychopathology.

Yet, to date, it remains unclear how high-level beliefs can impact such a wide range of behaviors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that priming disbelief in free will diminishes the sense of agency, i.e., the intrinsic sensation of being in control of one's own actions. To this end, we measured participants' implicit and explicit self-agency under both anti-free will and control conditions. Priming disbelief in free will reduced implicit but not explicit components of agency. These findings suggest that free will beliefs have a causal impact on the pre-reflective feeling of being in control of one's actions, and solidify previous proposals that implicit and explicit agency components tap into distinct facets of action awareness.","2014-12-17","2018-12-21 18:02:38","2018-12-21 18:02:38","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","agency; free will; intentional binding; self-control; unconscious","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These can manifest as lack of facial expressions and decreased speech production, reduced body posture and mobility, and slowed voluntary movement. The neural correlates of psychomotor disturbances in depression are poorly understood but it has been suggested that outputs from the cingulate motor area (CMA) to striatal motor regions, including the putamen, could be involved. We used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to conduct a region-of-interest analysis to test the hypotheses that neural activation patterns related to motor production and gray matter volumes in the CMA would be different between depressed subjects displaying psychomotor disturbances (n?=?13) and matched healthy controls (n?=?13). In addition, we conducted a psychophysiological interaction analysis to assess the functional coupling related to self-paced finger-tapping between the caudal CMA and the posterior putamen in patients compared to controls. We found a cluster of increased neural activation, adjacent to a cluster of decreased gray matter volume in the caudal CMA in patients compared to controls. The functional coupling between the left caudal CMA and the left putamen during finger-tapping task performance was additionally decreased in patients compared to controls. In addition, the strength of the functional coupling between the left caudal CMA and the left putamen was negatively correlated with the severity of psychomotor disturbances in the patient group. In conclusion, we found converging evidence for involvement of the caudal CMA and putamen in the generation of psychomotor disturbances in depression.","2014-12-04","2018-12-21 18:02:39","2018-12-21 18:02:39","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; cingulate cortex; cingulate motor area; major depression; psychomotor disturbances; putamen; striatum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods: There is no accepted definition of an FSS. Consequently, this paper reviewed the literature for common FSS characteristics and for reports that BPS/IC has these characteristics. Results: Eleven articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria and yielded 18 FSS characteristics. BPS/IC patients manifest all but two: the exceptions were normal light microscopic anatomy (after hydrodistention under anesthesia, some BPS/IC bladders have Hunner's lesions and most have petechial hemorrhages) and normal laboratory tests (many BPS/IC patients have hematuria). Petechial hemorrhages and hematuria are probably related and may appear during naturally-occurring bladder distention. Without such distention, then, the 90% of BPS/IC patients without a Hunner's lesion have all the characteristics of an FSS. Comparisons in the opposite direction were consistent: several additional features of BPS/IC were found in FSSs. Conclusions: This systematic but untested method is consistent with but does not test the hypothesis that BPS/IC in some patients might best be understood as an FSS. Like most conditions, BPS/IC is probably heterogeneous; hence only a proportion of BPS/IC cases are likely to be manifestations of an FSS. This hypothesis has several implications. Explorations of processes that connect the FSSs might contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of BPS/IC. Patients with FSSs are at risk for BPS/IC and may benefit from future preventive strategies. Therapies that are useful in FSSs also may be useful in some cases of BPS/IC.

Previous studies have shown that speech recognition performance in auditory-only conditions is better if the speaker is known not only by voice, but also by face. Here, we tested the hypothesis that such an improvement in auditory-only speech recognition depends on the ability to lip-read. To test this we recruited a group of adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a condition associated with difficulties in lip-reading, and typically developed controls. All participants were trained to identify six speakers by name and voice. Three speakers were learned by a video showing their face and three others were learned in a matched control condition without face. After training, participants performed an auditory-only speech recognition test that consisted of sentences spoken by the trained speakers. As a control condition, the test also included speaker identity recognition on the same auditory material. The results showed that, in the control group, performance in speech recognition was improved for speakers known by face in comparison to speakers learned in the matched control condition without face. The ASD group lacked such a performance benefit. For the ASD group auditory-only speech recognition was even worse for speakers known by face compared to speakers not known by face. In speaker identity recognition, the ASD group performed worse than the control group independent of whether the speakers were learned with or without face. Two additional visual experiments showed that the ASD group performed worse in lip-reading whereas face identity recognition was within the normal range. The findings support the view that auditory-only communication involves specific visual mechanisms. Further, they indicate that in ASD, speaker-specific dynamic visual information is not available to optimize auditory-only speech recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A quantitative methodology approach was adopted in this study. To test the hypothesized research model, data was collected from 569 undergraduate and postgraduate students studying in Lebanon via questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique based on AMOS methods in conjunction with multi-group analysis. The result revealed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), subjective norms (SN) and Quality of Work Life (QWL) positively affect students' behavioural intention (BI). We also found that experience moderates the relationship between PEOU, PU and SN on e-learning use intention, and that age difference moderates the effects of PEOU, SN and QWL on BI. In addition, educational level moderates the effects of PEOU, SN on BI, and gender moderates the effects of PU, SN and QWL on BI. Contrary to expectations, a moderating role of age on the relationship between PU and BI was not found. Similarly, gender was not found to affect the relationship between PEOU and BI, and educational level did not moderate the relationship between PU or QWL and BI. In light of these findings, implications to both theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many deception detection methodologies involve intrusive sensors or other limitations that preclude their use in a covert manner. Posturography may overcome these limitations by using minimally invasive force platform technology. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that posturography would reveal deception-related increases in postural rigidity similar to those observed with previous methodologies. Participants were randomly assigned to a control (CG) or experimental group (EG), and interviewed about the contents of a backpack in their possession while standing on a force platform. EG participants were asked to conceal the presence of several “prohibited” items in the backpack from the interviewer. Center of pressure (COP) measures from the force platform were used to characterize postural sway during participants' verbal responses. We observed a significant deception-related increase in sway frequency, an effect primarily occurring during longer responses that is likely related to increased cognitive load. These findings suggest deception-related increases in postural rigidity as reported in previous work, and demonstrate the feasibility of using posturography as a deception detection tool.

To this end, we conducted 4 studies that tested the hypothesis that American expressions of sympathy focus on the negative less and positive more than German expressions of sympathy, in part because Americans want to avoid negative states more than Germans do. In Study 1, we demonstrate that American sympathy cards contain less negative and more positive content than German sympathy cards. In Study 2, we show that European Americans want to avoid negative states more than Germans do. In Study 3, we demonstrate that these cultural differences in “avoided negative affect” mediate cultural differences in how comfortable Americans and Germans feel focusing on the negative (vs. positive) when expressing sympathy for the hypothetical death of an acquaintance's father. To examine whether greater avoided negative affect results in lesser focus on the negative and greater focus on the positive when responding to another person's suffering, in Study 4, American and German participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: (a) to “push negative images away” (i.e., increasing desire to avoid negative affect) from or (b) to “pull negative images closer” (i.e., decreasing desire to avoid negative affect) to themselves. Participants were then asked to pick a card to send to an acquaintance whose father had hypothetically just died. Across cultures, participants in the “push negative away” condition were less likely to choose sympathy cards with negative (vs. positive) content than were those in the “pull negative closer” condition. Together, these studies suggest that cultures differ in their desire to avoid negative affect and that these differences influence the degree to which expressions of sympathy focus on the negative (vs. positive). We discuss the implications of these findings for current models of sympathy, compassion, and helping.","2014-12","2018-12-21 18:02:43","2018-12-21 18:02:43","","1092-1115","","6","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","avoided negative affect; compassion; culture; emotion; sympathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After a habituation night in the sleep lab, a convenience sample of 11 healthy volunteers, whose attachment orientations were measured, were awoken once every hour and then reported any dream experienced. Dreams were then analyzed for content. Content analyses revealed progressively greater interactions between dreamer and other characters and greater spatial proximity between dreamer and other characters but not greater emotional intensity across the night in REM but not NREM dreams. Measures of dream length did not differ between REM and NREM dreams. While REM-dependent intimacy content tended to increase for all 3-attachment orientations, the rate of increase was slower for the avoidant group relative to both the secure or the preoccupied groups. Attachment content in dreams becomes more prominent in REM but not NREM dreams over the course of night.

The presence of language disturbances may be detected at earlier phases of the neurodegenerative process, like mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In daily verbal interactions, people mostly use literal language, but sometimes they employ non-literal language, which requires listeners to interpret messages beyond the plain meaning of the words and can be quite demanding. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that patients with MCI may have deficits in non-literal language, and these deficits are more pronounced than deficits in literal language. MethodsParticipants were recruited in a private memory clinic and senior universities. General cognitive evaluation included a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the instrumental activities of daily living scale. Literal language was assessed with the semantic decision test, Token Test, and literal text comprehension test, and non-literal language with the proverbs comprehension, idiomatic expressions and non-literal text comprehension tests. ResultsFifty-two participants with MCI and 31 controls were recruited. Patients with MCI had lower scores in all complex language tests, both literal (Token Test, semantic decision and literal text) and non-literal (proverbs, idiomatic expressions, and non-literal text), than the controls; the difference in literal text score was marginally significant. As much as 69% of MCI participants had deficits (performance below 1.5 SD of the mean) on at least one of the complex language tasks. Deficits were more frequent on the proverbs comprehension and semantic decision tests, and the deficits on these tests did not significantly differ from that on the Token Test. ConclusionPatients with MCI are hindered in understanding complex language, both literal and non-literal. In daily living, these complex language deficits could compromise effective verbal interactions with the others. Amelioration of these deficits should be an important intervention target as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy for patients with cognitive decline.","2014-12","2018-12-21 18:02:46","2018-12-21 18:02:46","","222-228","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","idiomatic expressions; literal language; mild cognitive impairment; non-literal language; proverbs; text comprehension","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recently found that an episodic specificity induction-brief training in recollecting details of past experiences-enhances performance of young and older adults on memory and imagination tasks. Here we tested the hypothesis that this specificity induction would also positively impact a means-end problem-solving task on which age-related changes have been linked to impaired episodic memory. Young and older adults received the specificity induction or a control induction before completing a means-end problem-solving task, as well as memory and imagination tasks. Consistent with previous findings, older adults provided fewer relevant steps on problem solving than did young adults, and their responses also contained fewer internal (i.e., episodic) details across the 3 tasks. There was no difference in the number of other (e.g., irrelevant) steps on problem solving or external (i.e., semantic) details generated on the 3 tasks as a function of age. Critically, the specificity induction increased the number of relevant steps and internal details (but not other steps or external details) that both young and older adults generated in problem solving compared with the control induction, as well as the number of internal details (but not external details) generated for memory and imagination. Our findings support the idea that episodic retrieval processes are involved in means-end problem solving, extend the range of tasks on which a specificity induction targets these processes, and show that the problem-solving performance of older adults can benefit from a specificity induction as much as that of young adults.","2014-12","2018-12-21 18:02:47","2018-12-21 18:02:47","","913-924","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; autobiographical memory; episodic specificity induction; imagination; means-end problem solving","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed when assessing 38 young adults, we found that both more incidences of negative exchanges reported during the past month as well as perceived negative appearance judgments by others were associated with more self-reported stress. Interestingly, however, for individuals with low attribution body esteem, higher numbers of positive social exchanges during the past month were related to health-relevant changes in biological markers of chronic stress as well. The same was true for individuals with high attribution body esteem who reported to experience only very few positive exchanges. As such, these findings go beyond the initial focus on low body esteem and negative social exchanges and introduce high body esteem as well as daily positive exchanges as potential health risk factors.

In contrast to some previous research, the present findings indicate that the CHR group (N = 314) reported exposure to more LE when compared to the HC group (N= 162). As predicted, CHR participants rated events as more stressful, and those who progressed to psychosis reported a greater frequency of LE and greater stress from events compared to those whose prodromal symptoms remitted. There was also some evidence of stress-sensitization; those who experienced more stress from LE rated current DH as more stressful. The results indicate that the “prodromal” phase is a period of heightened stress and stress sensitivity, and elevated cumulative lifetime exposure to stressful events may increase reactions to current stressors.

The authors tested the hypothesis that C-reactive protein (CRP), a commonly available marker of systemic inflammation, predicts differential response to escitalopram (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and nortriptyline (a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). Method: The hypothesis was tested in the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study, a multicenter open-label randomized clinical trial. CRP was measured with a high-sensitivity method in serum samples from 241 adult men and women with major depressive disorder randomly allocated to 12-week treatment with escitalopram (N=115) or nortriptyline (N=126). The primary outcome measure was the score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), administered weekly. Results: CRP level at baseline differentially predicted treatment outcome with the two antidepressants (CRP-drug interaction: beta=3.27, 95% CI=1.65, 4.89). For patients with low levels of CRP (<1 mg/L), improvement on the MADRS score was 3 points higher with escitalopram than with nortriptyline. For patients with higher CRP levels, improvement on the MADRS score was 3 points higher with nortriptyline than with escitalopram. CRP and its interaction with medication explained more than 10% of individual-level variance in treatment outcome. Conclusions: An easily accessible peripheral blood biomarker may contribute to improvement in outcomes of major depressive disorder by personalizing treatment choice.","2014-12","2018-12-21 18:02:50","2018-12-21 18:02:50","","1278-1286","","12","171","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The internalisation of stigma can have a negative impact on an individual's social relations and lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. Aim: This research is aimed at testing the hypothesis that the internalised stigma of mental illness contributes to the intensification of depressive symptoms indirectly, through its impact on feelings of loneliness. Methods: A total of 110 individuals with diagnoses of psychotic disorders (International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10): F20-F29) were assessed with measures of internalised stigma, loneliness, depression, positive and negative symptoms and global functioning. The ordinary least squares regression was used for data analysis. Results: After adding loneliness to the regression model, the initially significant impact of internalised stigma on depressive symptoms disappeared. As expected, loneliness proved to be a full mediator in the relationship between stigma and depression. Conclusion: The study findings provide useful insights into the mechanisms of the harmful effects of stigma on people with mental illness. Internalised stigma and loneliness should be considered important targets for interventions aiming to promote recovery.","2014-12","2018-12-21 18:02:50","2018-12-21 18:02:50","","733-740","","8","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","depression; loneliness; mental illness; Stigma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Data were from the humor therapy group of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns, or SMILE, study, a single-blind cluster randomized controlled trial of humor therapy conducted over 12 weeks; assessments were performed at baseline, week 13, and week 26. One hundred eighty-nine individuals from 17 Sydney residential aged care facilities were randomly allocated to the humor therapy intervention. Professional performers called “ElderClowns” provided 9-12 weekly humor therapy 2-hour sessions, augmented by trained staff, called “Laughter-Bosses.” Outcome measures were as follows: Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the withdrawal subscale of Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects, and proxy-rated quality of life in dementia population scale. Facility-level measures were as follows: support of the management for the intervention, commitment levels of LaughterBosses, Environmental Audit Tool scores, and facility level of care provided (high/low). Resident-level measures were engagement, functional ability, disease severity, and time-in-care. Multilevel path analyses simultaneously modeled resident engagement at the individual level (repeated measures) and the effects of management support and staff commitment to humor therapy at the cluster level. Results: Models indicated flow-on effects, whereby management support had positive effects on LaughterBoss commitment, and LaughterBoss commitment increased resident engagement. Higher resident engagement was associated with reduced depression, agitation, and neuropsychiatric scores. Conclusion: Effectiveness of psychosocial programs in residential aged care can be enhanced by management support, staff commitment, and active resident engagement.","2014-12","2018-12-21 18:02:51","2018-12-21 18:02:51","","1427-1437","","12","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Aged care; dementia; humor therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: Postal questionnaires that assessed EDB (binge eating, purging, extreme dietary restriction, excessive exercise and weight/shape overvaluation) and psychosocial impairment (general psychological distress, life satisfaction and social support) were completed by a general population sample of men (n = 957) and women (n = 1899). Results: Binge eating, purging and overvaluation were associated with comparable levels of psychosocial impairment for both men and women and this was the case for each of the three measures of psychosocial functioning employed. Extreme dietary restriction was associated with greater psychosocial impairment in women than in men, whereas excessive exercise was not associated with psychosocial impairment in either women or men. Conclusions: There appear to be few differences between men and women in terms of psychosocial impairment associated with EDB. It may no longer be appropriate to base the development of eating disorder prevention programs on the premise that EDB is primarily a problem of women. Health professionals may be more likely to see more men with EDB in their practices in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

MethodWe studied 1755 participants of the IMAGEN study, of average age 14.4years (SD=0.43), 50.7% girls. Manic symptoms were assessed using the Development and Wellbeing Assessment by interviewing parents and young people. Cognition was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children (WISC-IV) and a response inhibition task. ResultsManic symptoms in youth formed two correlated dimensions: one termed exuberance, characterized by high energy and cheerfulness and one of undercontrol with distractibility, irritability and risk-taking behavior. Only the undercontrol, but not the exuberant dimension, was independently associated with measures of psychosocial impairment. In multivariate regression models, the exuberant, but not the undercontrolled, dimension was positively and significantly associated with verbal IQ by both parent- and self-report; conversely, the undercontrolled, but not the exuberant, dimension was associated with poor performance in a response inhibition task. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that manic symptoms in youth may form dimensions with distinct correlates. The results are in keeping with previous findings about superior performance associated with mania.

Although much research has been devoted to the factors determining the magnitude and accuracy of FOK-Js, much less work has addressed the issue of whether FOK-Js are related to any form of metacognitive control over memory processes. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that FOK-Js are related to participants' choices of which unrecallable items should be restudied. In three experiments, we showed that participants tend to choose for restudy items with high FOK-Js, both when they are explicitly asked to choose for restudy items that can be mastered in the restudy session (Exps. 1a and 2) and when such specific instructions are omitted (Exp. 1b). The study further demonstrated that increasing FOK-Js via priming cues affects restudy choices, even though it does not affect recall directly. Finally, Experiment 2 showed the strategy of restudying unrecalled items with high FOK-Js to be adaptive, because the efficacy of restudy is greater for these items than for items with low FOK-Js. Altogether, the present findings underscore an important role of FOK-Js for the metacognitive control of study operations.","2014-12","2018-12-21 18:02:54","2018-12-21 18:02:54","","1617-1622","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Feeling of knowing; Metacognition; Restudy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was concluded from a vignette study in which anxious patients and non-clinical controls rated the dangerousness of scripts that were safe or dangerous and in which the protagonist did or did not display safety behaviors. Patients were more likely to take safety behavior as evidence that the situation was dangerous, especially in safe situations. Their non-clinical group may not have been psychologically naive. We critically replicated the Gangemi et al. study using a psychologically non-informed control group. Method: The same materials were used and patients (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia; n = 30 per sub-group) were compared to matched non-patients. Using Bayesian statistics, data from the Gangemi et al. samples and the present groups were (re-)analyzed testing the hypothesis relative to non-patients, patients infer threat from safety behaviors, especially if displayed in safe situations. Results: The Gangemi et al. data yielded a Bayes factor of 3.31 in support of the hypothesis. The present Bayes Factor was smaller (2.34), but strengthened the support for the hypothesis expressed by an updated Bayes factor of 331 x 2.34 = 7.75. Conclusions: The finding that anxious patients infer threat from safety behaviors, in particular in safe contexts, was corroborated, suggesting one way in which safety behaviors are involved in the maintenance of anxiety disorders.

Human genetic studies have discovered mutations disrupting exons of the NRXN2 gene, which encodes the synaptic adhesion protein a-neurexin II (Nrxn2a), in two unrelated individuals with autism, but a causal link between NRXN2 and the disorder remains unclear. To begin to test the hypothesis that Nrxn2a deficiency contributes to the symptoms of autism, we employed Nrxn2a knockout (KO) mice that genetically model Nrxn2a deficiency in vivo. We report that Nrxn2a KO mice displayed deficits in sociability and social memory when exposed to novel conspecifics. In tests of exploratory activity, Nrxn2a KO mice displayed an anxiety-like phenotype in comparison with wild-type littermates, with thigmotaxis in an open field, less time spent in the open arms of an elevated plus maze, more time spent in the enclosure of an emergence test and less time spent exploring novel objects. However, Nrxn2a KO mice did not exhibit any obvious changes in prepulse inhibition or in passive avoidance learning. Real-time PCR analysis of the frontal cortex and hippocampus revealed significant decreases in the mRNA levels of genes encoding proteins involved in both excitatory and inhibitory transmission. Quantification of protein expression revealed that Munc18-1, encoded by Stxbp1, was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of Nrxn2a KO mice, which is suggestive of deficiencies in presynaptic vesicular release. Our findings demonstrate a causal role for the loss of Nrxn2a in the genesis of autism-related behaviors in mice.","2014-11","2018-12-21 18:03:01","2018-12-21 18:03:01","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Internalizing symptoms were assessed from 4 to 13 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (n = 8,584); a clinical interview with the adolescents was conducted at age 15 years (n = 4,704). Obstetric and psychosocial risk and postnatal maternal symptoms were included as covariates. Results show that prenatal maternal anxiety predicted internalizing symptoms, including with the diagnostic assessment at 15 years. There was a main effect of two BDNF polymorphisms (rs6265 [val66met] and rs11030104) on internalizing symptoms up to age 13. There was also genetic moderation of the prenatal anxiety effect by different BDNF polymorphisms (rs11030121 and rs7124442), although significant effects were limited to preadolescence. The findings suggest a role for BDNF gene-environment interactions in individual vulnerability to the effects of prenatal anxiety on child internalizing symptoms.","2014-11","2018-12-21 18:03:02","2018-12-21 18:03:02","","1255-1266","","4, 2, SI","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that people with schizophrenia could also manifest perceptual inflexibility, or difficulties in the updating of their current sensory states. The presence of perceptual inflexibility might contribute both to the patients' altered perception of reality and the formation of some delusions as well as to their social cognition deficits. Here, we addressed this issue with a protocol of auditory hysteresis, a direct measure of sensory persistence, on a population of stabilized antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia patients and a sample of control subjects. Trials consisted of emotional signals (i.e., screams) and neutral signals (i.e., spectrally-rotated versions of the emotional stimuli) progressively emerging from white noise - Ascending Sequences - or progressively fading away in white noise Descending Sequences. Results showed that patients presented significantly stronger hysteresis effects than control subjects, as evidenced by a higher rate of perceptual reports in Descending Sequences. The present study thus provides direct evidence of perceptual inflexibility in schizophrenia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using data from 41 schizophrenia patients and 36 healthy comparison subjects, we replicated group differences in RSA and social cognition and also demonstrated that RSA and social cognition interact to predict how effectively patients manage work and independent living activities. Specifically, RSA did not enhance functional outcomes when social cognition was already strong, but higher levels of RSA enabled effective role functioning when social-cognitive performance was impaired. Jointly, RSA and social cognition accounted for 40% of the variance in outcome success, compared with 21% when evaluating social cognition alone.

The mechanisms linking urban living to psychopathology, however, remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that urban upbringing may alter the activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, one of the body's major stress response systems. Methods: In three independent experiments (n = 248 in total), we measured the changes in cortisol, the end-product of the HPA axis, in response to different stress tasks (memory recall with critical social evaluation [Experiment 1] or Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test [Experiment 2] and to awakening in participants raised in cities or more rural areas. Results: Urban upbringing was associated with elevated cortisol responses to acute stress (task x time point of measurement x urbanicity interaction: F(2,132) = 3.10 [p = .048] in Experiment 1 and F(2,112) = 3.29 [p = .041] in Experiment 2) but with a blunted cortisol awakening response (time point of measurement x urbanicity interaction: F(1,114) = 4.00, p = .048). The autonomic stress response, as indicated by blood pressure measurements, was not affected by urban upbringing. Moreover, current city living was not associated with any changes in the physiological responses to stress or awakening. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that urban upbringing changes the (re) activity of the HPA axis. Given that changes in HPA axis regulation have been associated with several psychiatric disorders, this may represent a mechanism that contributes to the increased risk for psychopathology in urban populations.","2014-12","2018-12-21 18:03:05","2018-12-21 18:03:05","","678-685","","9","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cortisol; cortisol awakening response; glucocorticoids; HPA axis; stress; urbanization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: In 312 women with incident BPS/IC, we diagnosed seven pre-BPS/IC syndromes: chronic pelvic pain (CPP), fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), sicca syndrome, migraine, and panic disorder. Each was defined as present before 12 months (existing syndrome) or onset within 12 months (new syndrome) prior to BPS/IC onset. Retrospectively, we sought associations between prior hysterectomy and existing FSSs. Prospectively, we studied associations of existing and new syndromes with subsequent hysterectomy. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, race, menopause and education. Results: The retrospective study showed prior hysterectomy (N = 63) to be associated with existing CPP and the presence of multiple existing FSSs. The prospective study revealed that 30/249 women with a uterus at baseline (12%) underwent hysterectomy in early BPS/IC This procedure was associated with new CPP (OR 6.0; CI 2.0, 18.2), new IBS (OR 5.4; CI 13, 223), and existing FSSs (OR 3.9; CI 1.1, 13.9). Conclusion: Accounting for CPP and IBS, the presence of multiple FSSs (most without pelvic pain) was a separate, independent risk factor for hysterectomy in early BPS/IC. This suggests that patient features in addition to abdominopelvic abnormalities led to this procedure. Until other populations are assessed, a prudent approach to patients who are contemplating hysterectomy (and possibly other surgeries) for pain and who have IBS or numerous FSSs is first to try alternative therapies including treatment of the FSSs.

We tested whether persistently delinquent individuals become more accepted by their peers during adolescence and whether individuals who abstain from delinquent behavior become less accepted. Participants were 4,359 adolescents from 14 communities in the PROSPER study, which assessed friendship networks and delinquency from 6th (M = 11.8 years) to 9th (M = 15.3 years) grade. We operationalized peer acceptance as number of nominations received (indegree centrality), attractiveness as a friend (adjusted indegree centrality), and network bridging potential (betweenness centrality) and tested the hypotheses with multilevel modeling. Contrary to Moffitt's hypothesis, persistently delinquent youths did not become more accepted between early and middle adolescence, and although abstainers were less accepted in early adolescence, they became more accepted over time. Results were similar for boys and girls; when differences occurred, they provided no support for Moffitt's hypotheses for boys and were opposite of her hypotheses for girls. Sensitivity analyses in which alternative strategies and additional data were used to identify persistently delinquent adolescents produced similar results. We explore the implications of these results for Moffitt's assertions that social mimicry of persistently antisocial adolescents leads to increases in delinquency and that social isolation leads to abstention.","2014-11","2018-12-21 18:03:06","2018-12-21 18:03:06","","2437-2448","","11","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","delinquency; peer acceptance; social networks; taxonomic theory of antisocial behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite several demonstrations of this delay-of-feedback benefit, a theoretical explanation for this finding has not yet been developed. The present study tested the hypothesis that brief delays of feedback are beneficial because they encourage anticipation of the upcoming feedback. In Experiment 1, participants answered obscure trivia questions, and before receiving the answer, they rated their curiosity to know the answer. The answer was then provided either immediately or after a 4-s delay. A later final test over the same questions revealed a significant delay-of-feedback benefit, but only for items that had been rated high in curiosity. Experiment 2 replicated this same effect and showed that the delay-of-feedback benefit only occurs when feedback is provided after a variable, unpredictable time duration (either 2, 4, or 8 s) rather than after a constant duration (always 4 s). These findings demonstrate that the delay-of-feedback effect appears to be greatest under conditions in which participants are curious to know the answer and when the answer is provided after an unpredictable time interval.","2014-11","2018-12-21 18:03:07","2018-12-21 18:03:07","","1273-1284","","8","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Curiosity; Delay of feedback; Memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that experiencing an offspring death (OD) is associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline in late life. Methods: This population-based longitudinal study observed four cognitive statuses spaced 3-4 years apart, linked to an extensive database containing objective genealogic and vital statistics data. Home visits were conducted with 3,174 residents of a rural county in northern Utah, initially without dementia, aged 65-105. Cognitive status was measured with the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam at baseline and at 3-, 7-, and 10-year follow-ups. OD was obtained from the Utah Population Database, which contains statewide birth and death records. Results: In linear mixed models, controlling for age, gender, education, and apolipoprotein E status, subjects who experienced OD while younger than age 31 years experienced a significantly faster rate of cognitive decline in late life, but only if they had an epsilon 4 allele. Reclassifying all OD (regardless of age) according to subsequent birth of another child, OD was only related to faster cognitive decline when there were no subsequent births. Conclusion: Experiencing OD in early adulthood has a long-term association with cognitive functioning in late life, with a gene-environment interaction at the apolipoprotein E locus. Subsequent birth of another child attenuates this association.","2014-11","2018-12-21 18:03:08","2018-12-21 18:03:08","","1307-1315","","11","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","apoE; Cognitive decline; psychosocial stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the balance between GR and MR signalling is disturbed, one's capacity to cope with a stressful event is diminished. In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis that an interaction between common variants in the MR (rs5522) or GR gene (rs41423247) and stressful life events influences perfectionism levels in a group of patients with an eating disorder (ED; n=113). Patients carrying the minor G allele of rs5522 had a higher perfectionism score if more stressful life events were experienced [=0.95, t(109)=3.75, p<0.01]. This effect was not found for patients carrying the AA genotype. These results suggest that rs5522 G allele carriers might be vulnerable to stressful life events. When patients with an ED are carriers and experience multiple life events, this might fuel their insecurity, which in turn may engender higher levels of perfectionism.

Few studies, however, have examined longitudinally when differential treatment effects may be observed and whether differential outcomes are associated with exposure to different risk factors and country of implementation. Also, birth asphyxia as a risk condition has not been well studied. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that there will be differential developmental trajectories favoring those who receive EDI versus a health education intervention in children in rural areas of India, Pakistan, and Zambia. MethodsChildren with and without birth asphyxia were randomized to EDI or control intervention, which was implemented by parents who received training in biweekly home visits initiated before child age 1month and continuing until 36months. Development was assessed in 376 children at ages 12, 24, and 36months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Ages & Stages Questionnaire administered by evaluators blind to intervention assignment and risk condition. ResultsLongitudinal mixed model analysis indicated that EDI resulted in better development over 36months in cognitive abilities, regardless of risk condition, maternal resources, child gender, or country. Psychomotor development and parent-reported general development showed similar trends as for cognitive abilities, but were not statistically different between intervention conditions. Developmental differences were observed first at 36months of age. ConclusionEarly developmental intervention has promise for improving development in children across developing countries when exposed to various risk conditions.

Experiment 2 replicated this effect of explanation in a case of label extension (i.e., categorization). Experiment 3 demonstrated that explanation improves memory for clusters of causally relevant (non-perceptual) features, but impairs memory for superficial (perceptual) features, providing evidence that effects of explanation are selective in scope and apply to memory as well as inference. In sum, our data support the proposal that engaging in explanation influences children's reasoning by privileging inductively rich, causal properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis showed that parental two-word sentences contain transparent information on the binary dependency/merge relation responsible for syntactic connectivity. The syntactic atoms modelled in the two-word input contain natural variables for dependents, making generalization to other contexts an immediate possibility. In a second study, a large sample of children were found to use the same verbs in the great majority of their early sentences expressing the same core grammatical relations.

In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) binding is reduced in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in impulsive aggressive patients. Additionally, we characterized pathological personality dimensions, with a specific focus on callousness (i.e. emotional indifference, a facet of psychopathy). Callousness is putatively positively correlated with presynaptic 5-HT, and thus could potentially confound the hypothesized negative relation between 5-HTT levels and trait aggression. We determined 5-HTT binding with positron emission tomography and [[C-11]DASB in 29 patients with intermittent explosive disorder (IED-IR) and 30 controls. We assessed group differences in 5-HTT binding in the pregenual ACC, amygdala and subcortical regions and examined correlations between 5-HTT binding and clinical measures. There were no significant differences in 5-HTT binding between IED-IR patients and controls. Trait callousness exhibited a significant, positive correlation with ACC 5-HTT availability. Among IED-IR patients, a trend-level negative partial correlation was observed between trait aggression and ACC 5-HTT availability, while covarying for callousness and age. Exploratory analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between state aggression levels and 5-HTT availability in subcortical regions, namely striatum and thalamus. We did not confirm our hypothesis of lower ACC 5-HTT availability in impulsive aggressive patients, however, the positive correlation between callousness and ACC 5-HTT availability likely played a confounding role. Subtypes of aggression (e.g., reactive vs. proactive aggression), which are differentially associated with pathological personality dimensions such as callousness, may contribute to variability between 5-HT functioning and aggression.

Emotion dysregulation is a multidimensional construct reflecting maladaptive ways in which a person experiences and responds to emotional states, and has also been empirically linked to aggression. This study sought to test the hypothesis that multiple facets of emotion dysregulation would mediate the relationship between negative affect and physical aggression in a nonclinical sample. An additional aim was to examine the moderating effect of sex in the relationship between negative affect and aggression, and whether mediators differ as a function of sex. Three-hundred and eighteen participants completed measures of physical aggression, difficulties in emotion regulation, and negative affect. Results showed that sex moderated the relationship between negative affect and physical aggression, and emotion dysregulation fully mediated the relationship between these variables in both males and females. While difficulty inhibiting impulsive behavior when distressed was a significant mediator across sexes, difficulties with emotional awareness demonstrated a mediation effect only in males. Findings provide preliminary support for the facets of emotion dysregulation that are important in understanding the negative affect physical aggression association in males and females.

Mate preferences for mutual attraction and love remained important and invariant over time, despite India's history of arranged marriages. Sex differences in mate preferences for cues to fertility (youth, physical attractiveness) and resources (good financial prospects, social status) remained relatively invariant over time. Several changes in mate preferences emerged, including a greater preference for mates who are “creative and artistic,” “ambitious and industrious,” and “a good cook and housekeeper” for both sexes. Despite cultural changes in India over the past 25 years, evolved mate preferences have persisted during this time period. Discussion highlights limitations of this research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An investigation of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms focusing on the outcome of unresolved anger (i.e., revenge), however, is absent from the literature. The objective of the present research was therefore to provide a first step towards filling this gap and, hence, to systematically examine the associations between OC symptoms and different aspects of revenge (i.e., attitudes, dispositions, motivations). In three independent studies with nonclinical participants (N=504), we tested the hypothesis that OC symptoms relate to greater revenge. Individuals high in OC symptoms reported more positive attitudes toward revenge (Study 1), scored higher on a measure of trait revenge (Study 2), and reported increased revenge motivation regarding a real-life transgressor (Study 3). Furthermore, Study 4 (N=175) demonstrated that individuals high in OC symptoms perceived interpersonal transgressions more frequently in their daily lives. OC symptoms were positively related to the number of transgressions that respondents disclosed. Our results suggest that revenge and interpersonal hurt play a significant role in OCD.

Previous research has demonstrated that individuals experience a challenge state when individuals have sufficient resources to cope with the demands of a task (Blascovich eta, 1993). Because the experience of resource availability has been shown to be associated with superficial processing (Garcia-Marques and Mackie, 2007), we tested the hypothesis that challenge is associated with superficial processing in two persuasion experiments. Experiment 1 revealed that inducing attitudes of participants in a challenge state was not sensitive to the quality of arguments presented. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the effect occurs even when task engagement, manipulated by the presence (vs. the absence) of a task observer (Blascovich et al., 1993), is high. The implications of these results for the biopsychosocial model model and the cognitive and motivational literature are discussed.","2014-10-14","2018-12-21 18:03:18","2018-12-21 18:03:18","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","biopsychosocial model; challenge; dual-processing; persuasion; threat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using theories regarding the frog-pond effect, which relates to how an individual perceives themselves in relation to that of those around them, and relative deprivation, we tested the hypothesis that employees who were personally more affected by a potential stressor, yet were in an organizational unit less affected by that stressor, would report more negative outcomes than employees who were subjected to the same stress but were in more affected units. Utilizing multilevel modelling and departmental- and individual-level data from a university experiencing severe budget cuts, it was found that both individual perceived budget cut impacts and departmental impacts were related to less job satisfaction, reduced affective commitment, greater perceptions of psychological contract breach and increased turnover intentions, supporting COR theory. Interestingly, as predicted by the frog-pond effect and relative deprivation theory, affected academic staff within departments that were less affected by the cuts had more negative responses than equally impacted individuals in more affected departments. We concluded that the frog-pond effect is relevant to work stress research and practice.","2014-10-02","2018-12-21 18:03:19","2018-12-21 18:03:19","","387-403","","4","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","budget cuts; conservation of resources; frog-pond effect; multilevel modelling; relative deprivation theory; work-related stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research suggests that serotonin promotes the development and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We tested the hypothesis whether exposure to SSRIs is associated with an increased risk of HCC in HCV patients. Method: Patients who entered the United States Veterans Affairs (VA) Hepatitis C Clinical Case Registry in 2000 to 2009 were analyzed. During the 8 years of follow-up, 36,192 patients filled at least 1 SSRI prescription. Cases of HCC were identified by diagnosis codes (ICD-9 155.0). Multivariable Cox regression analyses estimated adjusted HCC hazard ratios (HRs) for SSRI-exposed versus SSRI unexposed subjects and categories of average SSRI doses. Results: The annual incidence of HCC in the VA registry cohort of 109,736 patients was 0.5% and significantly greater in the 8% with cirrhosis at baseline (HR = 5.2; 95% CI, 4.7-5.7). There was no evidence for significant interactions between the effect of SSRI-exposure and cirrhosis. Baseline characteristics of the exposed (n = 36,192) and unexposed (n = 73,544) subjects were similar. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up period after SSRI-exposure began was 44 (20-74) months with 18 (3-49) months between the first and last prescription. The median average SSRI dose during follow-up expressed as a fraction of initial recommended doses for depression was 0.94 (IQR, 0.5 to 1.3). The risk of HCC was not significantly increased after SSRI exposure (HR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.87-1.05) or with increasing SSRI doses. Conclusions: Analysis of a large cohort of HCV patients did not support the hypothesis that SSRIs increase the risk of developing HCC.

Since 1996, over 3000 DNA samples from Utah suicide decedents have been collected and banked for research use through the Utah Medical Examiner. In addition, over 12 000 Utah suicides were identified through examination of death certificates back to 1904. By linking this data with the Utah Population Database, we have identified multiple extended pedigrees with increased risk for suicide completion. A number of medical conditions co-occur with suicide, including asthma, and this study was undertaken to identify genetic risk common to asthma and suicide. This study tests the hypothesis that a particular comorbid condition may identify a more homogeneous genetic subgroup, facilitating the identification of specific genetic risk factors in that group. From pedigrees at increased risk for suicide, we identified three pedigrees also at significantly increased familial risk for asthma. Five suicide decedents from each of these pedigrees, plus an additional three decedents not from these pedigrees with diagnosed asthma, and 10 decedents with close relatives with asthma were genotyped. Results were compared with 183 publicly available unaffected control exomes from 1000 Genomes and CEPH (Centre d'etude du polymorphisme humain) samples genotyped on the same platform. A further 432 suicide decedents were also genotyped as non-asthma suicide controls. Genotyping was done using the Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. For analysis, we used the pedigree extension of Variant Annotation, Analysis and Search Tool (pVAAST) to calculate the disease burden of each gene. The Phenotype Driven Variant Ontological Re-ranking tool (Phevor) then re-ranked our pVAAST results in context of the phenotype. Using asthma as a seed phenotype, Phevor traversed biomedical ontologies and identified genes with similar biological properties to those known to result in asthma. Our top associated genes included those related to neurodevelopment or neural signaling (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (SMPD2), homeobox b2 (HOXB2), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM2), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A0 (HNRNPA0)), inflammation (free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)) and inflammation with additional evidence of neuronal involvement (oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)). Of particular interest, BDNF has been previously implicated in both psychiatric disorders and asthma. Our results demonstrate the utility of combining pedigree and co-occurring phenotypes to identify rare variants associated with suicide risk in conjunction with specific co-occurring conditions.","2014-10","2018-12-21 18:03:20","2018-12-21 18:03:20","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Processing speed has been identified as a crucial factor in cognitive efficiency in this population. We tested the hypothesis that decreased processing speed underlies the verbal working memory deficit in patients and mediates the associations between working memory span and clinical symptoms. Method: Forty-nine schizophrenia inpatients recruited from units for chronic and acute patients, and forty-five healthy participants, were involved in the study. Verbal working memory span was assessed by means of the letter-number span. The Digit Copy test was used to assess motor speed, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test to assess cognitive speed. Results: The working memory span was significantly impaired in patients (F(1,90) = 4.6, P < 0.05). However, the group difference was eliminated when either the motor or the cognitive speed measure was controlled (F(1,89) = 0.03, P = 0.86, and F(1,89) = 0.03, P = 0.88). In the patient group, working memory span was significantly correlated with negative symptoms (r = -0.52, P < 0.0001) and thought disorganisation (r = -0.34, P < 0.025) scores. Regression analyses showed that the association with negative symptoms was no longer significant when the motor speed measure was controlled (beta = -0.12, P = 0.20), while the association with thought disorganisation was no longer significant when the cognitive speed measure was controlled (beta = -0.10, P = 0.26).

Our purpose is twofold. First, we seek to contrast the procedural utility hypothesis, whereby different sources of income may contribute differentially to personal income satisfaction. In particular, we compare labour earnings and non-labour income. Second, we set out to test the hypothesis of relative income within the household. Does the income level of one individual regarding other members of the same household matter in personal income satisfaction? These two hypotheses are relevant to policy-making regarding subsidies, taxation and active labour market programmes. We use data for Spain and Denmark in the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). In general terms, and for both countries, our results seem to confirm both the procedural hypothesis and the relative income hypothesis. Labour income contributes more to individual financial satisfaction than non-labour income for both household partners (men and women) in the two countries.

That research has also shown that category-level correlations serve as a proxy for inferring exemplar-level correlations. For example, an individual may learn that the demand for a product category, like cheese, in one store predicts the demand for this category in another. The individual could then draw the unwarranted conclusion that the demand for an exemplar, like cheddar, would also predict the demand for this exemplar in the other store. This notion is supported by previous experiments demonstrating that the subjective exemplar-level correlation follows the implication of the category-level correlation. However, in virtually all previous experiments suggesting a processing advantage for category-level over exemplar-level correlations, the stimulus correlation at the category level was substantial, whereas the correlation at the exemplar level was weak. Here, we tested the hypothesis that individuals process the level that is most informative, either the exemplar or the category level. We presented participants with a zero correlation at the category level, but varied the correlation at the exemplar level. Participants presented with a zero correlation across exemplar products correctly reproduced a zero correlation across product categories. When presented with a substantial correlation at the exemplar level, however, they erroneously reproduced a similar correlation at the category level. These findings therefore imply that there is no general processing advantage for correlations at higher aggregation levels. Instead, individuals seemingly attend to the level that holds the most regular information. Findings are discussed regarding the role of covariation strength in correlation detection and use.","2014-10","2018-12-21 18:03:24","2018-12-21 18:03:24","","1316-1322","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Category learning; Contingency learning; Correlation assessment; Correlation size; Memory; Pseudocontingencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies have reported increased serum levels of these inflammatory markers in depression, first-episode psychosis, and acute psychotic relapse; however, the direction of the association has been unclear. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that higher serum levels of IL-6 and CRP in childhood would increase future risks for depression and psychosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective general population birth cohort study based in Avon County, England. We have studied a subsample of approximately 4500 individuals from the cohort with data on childhood IL-6 and CRP levels and later psychiatric assessments. MEASUREMENT OF EXPOSURE Levels of IL-6 and CRP were measured in nonfasting blood samples obtained in participants at age 9 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants were assessed at age 18 years. Depression was measured using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) and Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ), thus allowing internal replication; psychotic experiences (PEs) and psychotic disorder were measured by a semistructured interview. RESULTS After adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, ethnicity, social class, past psychological and behavioral problems, and maternal postpartum depression, participants in the top third of IL-6 values compared with the bottom third at age 9 years were more likely to be depressed (CIS-R) at age 18 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.13-2.14). Results using the MFQ were similar. Risks of PEs and of psychotic disorder at age 18 years were also increased with higher IL-6 levels at baseline (adjusted OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.01-3.28; and adjusted OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 0.88-6.22, respectively). Higher IL-6 levels in childhood were associated with subsequent risks of depression and PEs in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Higher levels of the systemic inflammatory marker IL-6 in childhood are associated with an increased risk of developing depression and psychosis in young adulthood. Inflammatory pathways may provide important new intervention and prevention targets for these disorders. Inflammation might explain the high comorbidity between heart disease, diabetes mellitus, depression, and schizophrenia.","2014-10","2018-12-21 18:03:25","2018-12-21 18:03:25","","1121-1128","","10","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Musical expertise improves how precisely auditory and visual signals are perceptually integrated and increases sensitivity to asynchrony between them. Whether expertise improves sensitivity to audiovisual asynchrony in all instrumental contexts or only in those using sound-producing gestures that are within an observer's own motor repertoire is unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that musicians are more sensitive to audiovisual asynchrony in performances featuring their own instrument than in performances featuring other instruments. Short clips were extracted from audio-video recordings of clarinet, piano, and violin performances and presented to highly-skilled clarinetists, pianists, and violinists. Clips either maintained the audiovisual synchrony present in the original recording or were modified so that the video led or lagged behind the audio. Participants indicated whether the audio and video channels in each clip were synchronized. The range of asynchronies most often endorsed as synchronized was assessed as a measure of participants' sensitivities to audiovisual asynchrony. A positive relationship was observed between musical training and sensitivity, with data pooled across stimuli. While participants across expertise groups detected asynchronies most readily in piano stimuli and least readily in violin stimuli, pianists showed significantly better performance for piano stimuli than for either clarinet or violin. These findings suggest that, to an extent, the effects of expertise on audiovisual integration can be instrument-specific; however, the nature of the sound-producing gestures that are observed has a substantial effect on how readily asynchrony is detected as well.","2014-10-01","2018-12-21 18:03:25","2018-12-21 18:03:25","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","action prediction; ensemble performance; interpersonal coordination; multisensory integration; musical expertise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to test a hypothesized model based on the theoretical and empirical literature: better caregiver health, better survivor health, and better family functioning contribute directly to fewer caregiving demands, which in turn contribute to greater caregiver competence. Method: Telephone interviews using structured self-report questionnaires were conducted in this cross-sectional study with a sample of 186 caregivers (mothers) of childhood brain tumor survivors aged 14-40 years old who live with at least one parent. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesized model. Results: The final SEM model suggests that survivor health and family functioning directly predict caregiver competence. Caregiver health indirectly predicts caregiver competence through caregiver demands and then family functioning. Family income directly predicts family functioning. The model showed adequate fit (CFI = 0.905, TFI = 0.880, and RMSEA = 0.081). Overall, the model accounted for 45% of variance in caregiver competence. Conclusions: For this sample of caregivers of AYA with medically complex conditions, family functioning and the health of survivors are both important to how they evaluate their skills as caregivers. The results of this study underscore the crucial role of care models that focus on optimizing the health of the survivor, caregiver, and family, along with supporting a family centered approach to their care.","2014-10","2018-12-21 18:03:26","2018-12-21 18:03:26","","1103-1112","","10","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescent and young adult brain tumor survivors; caregiving competence; caregiving demands; family functioning; medically complex adolescents and young adults","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A group of Chinese-speaking six-grade students took a multi-trial L2 (English) word learning task after being exposed to a set of familiar words that rhymed with the target words. Children's PA was measured at grade 3. Children with relatively poorer L1 PA and those with better L1 PA did not differ in identifying the forms of the new words. However, children with poorer L1 PA demonstrated reduced performance in naming pictures with labels that rhymed with the pre-exposure words than with labels that did not rhyme with the pre-exposure words. Children with better L1 PA were not affected by the recurring rime shared by the pre-exposure words and the target words.

This study aims to test the hypothesis that levels of self-reported discrimination in people with depression are inversely associated with social capital levels. A total of 434 people with major depression recruited in outpatient settings across 15 European countries participated in the study. Multivariable regression was used to analyse relationships between discrimination and interpersonal and institutional trust, social support and social network. Significant inverse association was found between discrimination and social capital in people with major depression. Specifically, people with higher levels of social capital were less likely to have elevated or substantially elevated levels of experienced discrimination. Higher level of social capital may be closely associated with lower level of experienced discrimination among patients with major depression. It is important to explore these associations more deeply and to establish possible directions of causality in order to identify interventions that may promote social capital and reduce discrimination. This may permit greater integration in society and more access to important life opportunities for people with depression.","2014-10","2018-12-21 18:03:29","2018-12-21 18:03:29","","1589-1598","","10","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Depression; Discrimination; Multisite study; Social capital; Social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study aimed to address this dearth in the literature and test the hypothesis that sexual coercion has a negative impact on victims' subsequent romantic experiences. Using a sample of 94 youth (44 males and 50 females), the current study addressed the impact of sexual coercion on romantic relationship quality and dating experiences. Tracking youth for 8.5 years (M age at Wave 1 = 15.10 years, SD = .49), the current study used piecewise growth curve modeling to account for shifts in the intercept and slope of romantic experiences following sexual coercion. Negative interactions immediately increased following coercion and continued to have an accelerated rate of growth (i.e., a slope change). Jealousy in romantic relationships increased in slope. Serious dating decelerated following the coercive incident. Results were largely consistent across gender and severity of the coercive incident. Contrary to hypotheses, relational support, relationship satisfaction, and casual dating did not significantly change following sexual coercion. Consistent with hypotheses, sexual coercion had a negative impact on romantic experiences. These findings have clinical implications for both prevention and intervention around sexual violence. In addition, the consistency of findings across gender and severity suggests that increased focus should be directed toward both male sexual coercion and less severe sexual coercion.","2014-10","2018-12-21 18:03:29","2018-12-21 18:03:29","","1431-1441","","7","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Dating violence; Romantic relationships; Sexual aggression; Sexual coercion; Sexual victimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study is to analyze the role of activity restriction in the pain-depression relationship in older people, and to test the hypothesis that this role is more relevant in community-dwelling older people than in nursing home residents. Method: Depressive symptoms, pain intensity, and activity restriction were measured in a sample of 208 older adults with osteoarthritis, 102 living in nursing homes (NH), and 106 in the community. Analyses were carried out using moderation and moderated mediation analyses approach, treating activity restriction as a confounder. Results: Results showed a significant confounding effect of activity restriction, interaction effect between pain intensity and activity restriction on depression, and modifying effect of pain intensity on depression by adding activity restriction into the model. These results suggest a potential mediating and moderating effects of activity restriction. Moreover, analyses suggest that, surprisingly, the strength of the mediation could be higher in nursing homes. Conclusions: Overall, it may be that what is really important to emotional well-being is not so much pain itself, but rather the way in which the pain alters older people's lives. The greater strength of the mediation in NH might be understood within the scope of self-determination theory. Generally speaking, the NH context has been considered as a coercive setting, promoting non-autonomous orientation. In this context, when events are objectively coercive, people may lack perceived autonomy and hence be at greater risk of depression.","2014-10","2018-12-21 18:03:32","2018-12-21 18:03:32","","1679-1691","","10","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","activity restriction; autonomy; chronic pain; depression; elderly; osteoarthritis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, deficient amygdala habituation, defined as a change in response to repeated relative to novel unpleasant pictures within a session, has emerged as a biological correlate of Al in BPD. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), an evidence-based treatment, targets Al by teaching emotion-regulation skills. This study tested the hypothesis that BPD patients would exhibit decreased amygdala activation and improved habituation, as well as improved emotion regulation with standard 12-month DBT. Methods: Event-related fMRI was obtained pre- and post-12-months of standard-DBT in unmedicated BPD patients. Healthy controls (HCs) were studied as a benchmark for normal amygdala activity and change over time (n = 11 per diagnostic-group). During each scan, participants viewed an intermixed series of unpleasant, neutral and pleasant pictures presented twice (novel, repeat). Change in emotion regulation was measufed with the Difficulty in Emotion Regulation (DERS) scale. Results: fMRI results showed the predicted Group x Time interaction: compared with HCs, BPD patients exhibited decreased amygdala activation with treatment. This post-treatment amygdala reduction in BPD was observed for all three pictures types, but particularly marked in the left hemisphere and during repeated-emotional pictures. Emotion regulation measured with the DERS significantly improved with DBT in BPD patients. Improved amygdala habituation to repeated-unpleasant pictures in patients was associated with improved overall emotional regulation measured by the DERS (total score and emotion regulation strategy use subscale). Conclusion: These findings have promising treatment implications and support the notion that DBT targets amygdala hyperactivity part of the disturbed neural circuitry underlying emotional dysregulation in BPD. Future work includes examining how DBT-induced amygdala changes interact with frontal-lobe regions implicated in emotion regulation.

Methods: Data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) were extracted for secondary data analyses on the rates of major depression disorder (MDD) and major depressive episode (MDE) in the two groups. Results: Findings showed that for life time MDD, the rates for China-to-US immigrant and US-born Chinese were 5.3% and 7.9% for men and 8.5% and 33.1% for women. For 12-month MDD, the corresponding rates were 2.2% and 3.4% for men, and 4.7% and 12.6% for women. For life time MDE, the corresponding rates were 6.8% and 8.8% for men; for women the rates were 8.5% and 33.1%. For 12-month MDE, the rates were 2.2% and 4.4% for men; the rates were 4.7% and 12.6% for women. Controlling for age, education level, income, BMI, marital status, and income-to-needs ratio, China-to-US immigrant women remained less likely to have life time major depression than US-born Chinese American women. Limitations: While the study has the strength of utilizing nationally representative datasets, the approach is limited as the data sources lack the capacity to investigate how the strength of connection with the collectivist culture might be related to major depression in the immigrant group.

I ask: how do customers develop impressions of the goodness and power for computers agents compared to human agents? I propose a theoretical model by which the agent's computer identity weakens social processes that lead to goodness and power impressions. This model explains conflicting prior research and proposes specific hypotheses for the current study. I test the hypotheses with a laboratory experiment where participants believe they are buying products online from a representative of a real organization. I manipulate product quality to alter goodness impressions, the organization's constraint of the representative to alter power impressions, and human versus computer identity to test the hypothesized weakening interaction effects. The weakening hypothesis for goodness is not supported, while the weakening hypothesis for power is fully supported. Future work should test the goodness and power weakening hypotheses under different conditions and with different manipulations to determine under what conditions the former operates and to provide additional support for the latter.

We tested the hypothesis that the discrepancy is associated with paternal age, controlling for the number of endophenotypes shared between proband and his or her sibling, and proband age, which were both associated with paternal age. The non-significant association between the discrepancy and paternal age was in the opposite direction from the hypothesis. Of the 11 endophenotypes only sensori-motor dexterity was significant, but in the opposite direction. Eight other endophenotypes were also in the opposite direction, but not significant. The results did not support the hypothesized association of increased differences between sibling/proband pairs with greater paternal age.

This article examines the consequences of this interference in sentence production and tests the hypothesis that in situations of high similarity-based interference, producers are more likely to omit one of the interfering elements than when there is low semantic similarity and thus low interference.This work investigated language production in Mandarin, which allows subject noun phrases to be omitted in discourse contexts in which the subject entity has been previously mentioned in the discourse. We hypothesize that Mandarin speakers omit the subject more often when the subject and the object entities are conceptually similar. A corpus analysis of simple transitive sentences found higher rates of subject omission when both the subject and object were animate (potentially yielding similarity-based interference) than when the subject was animate and object was inanimate. A second study manipulated subject-object animacy in a picture description task and replicated this result: participants omitted the animate subject more often when the object was also animate than when it was inanimate. These results suggest that similarity-based interference affects sentence forms, particularly when the agent of the action is mentioned in the sentence. Alternatives and mechanisms for this effect are discussed.","2014-09-16","2018-12-21 18:03:37","2018-12-21 18:03:37","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","grammatical encoding; interference; language production; sentence production; subject omission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The integration of both types of elements is necessary for social interaction. No study has investigated how these processes are impaired in patients with schizophrenia during the comprehension of an emotional speech. Since patients with schizophrenia have difficulty in daily interactions, it would be of great interest to investigate how these processes are impaired. We tested the hypothesis that patients present lesser performances regarding both semantic and emotional prosodic processes during emotional speech comprehension compared with healthy participants. Methods: The paradigm is based on sentences built with emotional (anger, happiness, or sadness) semantic content uttered with or without congruent emotional prosody. The study participants had to decide with which of the emotional categories each sentence corresponded. Results: Patients performed significantly worse than their matched controls, even in the presence of emotional prosody, showing that their ability to understand emotional semantic content was impaired. Although prosody improved performances in both groups, it benefited the patients more than the controls. Conclusion: Patients exhibited both impaired semantic and emotional prosodic comprehensions. However, they took greater advantage of emotional prosody adjunction than healthy participants. Consequently, focusing on emotional prosody during carrying may improve social communication.","2014-09-10","2018-12-21 18:03:38","2018-12-21 18:03:38","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","emotion recognition; emotional discourse; emotional prosody; language system; schizophrenia; semantic comprehension; social cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Across religious affiliations, participants reported that their religious belief systems encourage magnanimous behavior. In addition, priming their religious belief systems caused them to act more magnanimously, but only when motivated to adhere to salient ideals (i.e., after threats; see Gailliot, Stillman, Schmeichel, Maner, & Plant, 2008; Jonas et al., 2008). Specifically, in Studies 1-5, we found that a general religious belief system prime (”Which religious belief system do you identify with?”) reduced the hostility of people's thoughts, behaviors, and judgments following threat. In Studies 6 and 7, we found that the religious belief system prime only reduced hostile reactions to threat among participants who held religious beliefs that oriented them toward magnanimous ideals (Study 6) and who were dispositionally inclined to adhere to their ideals (Study 7). In Study 8, we found support for the role of magnanimous ideals by demonstrating that directly priming these ideals yielded effects similar to those produced by a religious belief system prime.

The current study takes a novel approach to explaining this seemingly paradoxical effect when it comes to physical attractiveness a highly evaluative trait that is especially relevant to romantic relationships. Specifically, we argue that people are aware that others do not see their partners as positively as they do. Using both mean differences and correlational approaches, we test the hypothesis that despite their own biased and idiosyncratic perceptions, people have 2 types of partner-knowledge: insight into how their partners see themselves (i.e., identity accuracy) and insight into how others see their partners (i.e., reputation accuracy). Our results suggest that romantic partners have some awareness of each other's identity and reputation for physical attractiveness, supporting theories that couple members' perceptions are driven by motives to fulfill both esteem- and epistemic-related needs (i.e., to see their partners positively and realistically).","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:03:40","2018-12-21 18:03:40","","516-528","","3","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attractiveness; bias; interpersonal perception; realism; romantic partners","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J.","Gender moderates the effect of exercise on anxiety sensitivity","MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY","","1755-2966","10.1016/j.mhpa.2014.08.002","","A moderate to vigorous intensity exercise program is emerging as a promising strategy for reducing anxiety sensitivity (AS). Initial evidence suggests that the effects of exercise on mental health outcomes may vary as a function of gender, with men benefitting more than women. Building upon this evidence, the present study tested the hypothesis that the effect of exercise on AS would vary as a function of gender, such that the effect would be stronger for men than for women. We tested this hypothesis using the data from a published study (Smits, Berry, Rosenfield, et al., 2008). In this study, participants (N = 60) with elevated levels of AS were randomly assigned to a two-week exercise intervention [EX] or a waitlist control condition [WL]. Results revealed that males showed significantly greater initial AS reductions relative to females (following 1 week of exercise). However, these gender differences were no longer evident at the end of the intervention. Possible mechanisms for the observed findings and directions for future research are discussed.

Method: Data from a study conducted between August 2007 and July 2011 were reanalyzed retrospectively. Patients (N = 245) meeting criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR, were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with bupropion extended-release, escitalopram, or the combination. Negative affectivity score was estimated using the guilt, hostility/irritability, and fear/anxiety items of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, and the Social Adjustment Scale. We felt that these items captured published descriptions of the NA construct. A Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score = 2 defined response. Because combined treatment addressed both serotonin and non-serotonin systems, patients treated with both medications did not test the hypothesis and so were excluded from the analyses. Results: Analysis of covariance with treatment as a grouping variable, NA as covariate, and CGI-S as dependent variable showed a significant 2-way interaction between treatment and NA (F-1,F-156 = 4.82, P < .03). In the low-NA group, response rates were similar between treatments (escitalopram: 28/42 [67%]; bupropion: 23/40 [58%]; NS), while there was a significant advantage for escitalopram in patients with high NA (escitalopram: 24/40 [60%]; bupropion = 14/41 [34%]; P = .017). Conclusions: These data suggest that patients with high negative affectivity respond preferentially to antidepressants that selectively enhance serotonin neurotransmission. Although patients with low NA appear to benefit from serotonin enhancement as well, they also improved with bupropion, an antidepressant not thought to directly affect serotonin neurotransmission. These findings come from retrospective analyses using unproven approximation of NA, so no clinical inferences should be made before independent replication utilizing accepted NA measurement.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:03:42","2018-12-21 18:03:42","","E939-E944","","9","75","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present exploratory study investigated this claim by combining findings in chronobiology, mood research and music perception. It has already been established that some aspects of our mood fluctuations follow a cyclical pattern. Besides, it is a known fact that our current mood influences our perception and assessment of emotions. However, these elements have never been linked together in a study examining the effect of mood cyclicity on perceived emotions in music. To test the hypothesis of a link between the two, Western film music excerpts were played to 36 participants at two different times (9 a.m. and 4 p.m.). Their task was to rate the perceived emotional content of each clip. The results showed that sad and tender clips were rated higher on sadness and tenderness in the morning compared to the afternoon. Furthermore, the more tired the participants were in the afternoon, the higher was their perception of fear in angry and fearful music. Although the reported effect sizes were small, these findings could have important implications for ethnomusicologists, emotion researchers and music therapists.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:03:42","2018-12-21 18:03:42","","256-274","","3, SI","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","circadian rhythms; emotion; Indian classical music; music; raga","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Epigenetic changes can be induced by environmental exposures such as inflammation. Here we tested the hypothesis that prenatal inflammation, a recognized risk factor for schizophrenia and related neurodevelopmental conditions, alters DNA methylation in key brain regions linked to schizophrenia, namely the dopamine rich striatum and endocrine regulatory centre, the hypothalamus. DNA methylation across highly repetitive elements (long interspersed element 1 (LINE1) and intracisternal A-particles (IAPs)) were used to proxy global DNA methylation. We also investigated the Mecp2 gene because it regulates transcription of LINE1 and has a known association with neurodevelopmental disorders. Brain tissue was harvested from 6 week old offspring of mice exposed to the viral analog PolyI:C or saline on gestation day 9. We used Sequenom EpiTYPER assay to quantitatively analyze differences in DNA methylation at IAPs, LINE1 elements and the promoter region of Mecp2. In the hypothalamus, prenatal exposure to PolyI: C caused significant global DNA hypomethylation (t = 2.44, P = 0.019, PolyI: C mean 69.67%, saline mean 70.19%), especially in females, and significant hypomethylation of the promoter region of Mecp2, (t = 3.32, P = 0.002; PolyI: C mean 26.57%, saline mean 34.63%). IAP methylation was unaltered. DNA methylation in the striatum was not significantly altered. This study provides the first experimental evidence that exposure to inflammation during prenatal life is associated with epigenetic changes, including Mecp2 promoter hypomethylation. This suggests that environmental and genetic risk factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders may act upon similar pathways. This is important because epigenetic changes are potentially modifiable and their investigation may open new avenues for treatment.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:03:43","2018-12-21 18:03:43","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the precise role of the STN during nonmotor functions remains controversial. First, we tested whether functionally distinct neuronal populations support different executive control functions (such as inhibitory control or error monitoring) even within a single subterritory of the STN. We used microelectrode recordings during deep brain stimulation surgery to study extracellular activity of the putative associative-limbic part of the STN while patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder performed a stop-signal task. Second, 2-4 days after the surgery, local field potential recordings of STN were used to test the hypothesis that STN oscillations may also reflect executive control signals. Extracellular recordings revealed three functionally distinct neuronal populations: the first one fired selectively before and during motor responses, the second one selectively increased their firing rate during successful inhibitory control, and the last one fired selectively during error monitoring. Furthermore, we found that beta band activity (15-35 Hz) rapidly increased during correct and incorrect behavioral stopping. Taken together, our results provide critical electrophysiological support for the hypothesized role of the STN in the integration of motor and cognitive-executive control functions.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:03:44","2018-12-21 18:03:44","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that the expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT) is decreased in the amygdala of subjects with schizophrenia. In normal control, schizophrenic subjects and bipolar disorder subjects, we measured numerical density of axon varicosities immunoreactive (IR) for DAT in the lateral (LN), basal, accessory basal (ABN), and cortical (CO) nuclei and intercalated cell masses (ITCM) of the amygdala. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IR and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH)-IR varicosities were measured to test for potential loss of varicosities and serotonin transporter (5HTT)-IR for involvement of the serotoninergic system. Among several potential confounding variables tested, particular emphasis was placed on exposure to therapeutic drugs. In schizophrenic subjects, DAT-IR varicosities were decreased in LN (P = .0002), ABN (P = .013), and CO (P = .0001) in comparison with controls, and in comparison with bipolar disorder subjects in LN (P = .004) and CO (P = .002). DBH-IR varicosities were decreased in ABN (P = .008) and ITCM (P = .017), compared with controls. TH- and 5HTT-IR varicosities were not altered. No changes were detected in bipolar disorder. Taken together with TH and DBH findings, reductions of DAT-IR varicosities point to decreased DAT expression in dopaminergic terminals in the amygdala of subjects with schizophrenia. This DAT decrease may disrupt dopamine uptake, leading to increased dopaminergic synaptic transmission and spillage into the extracellular space with activation of extrasynaptic dopamine receptors. Concurrent decrease of noradrenaline in the ABN may disrupt memory consolidation.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:03:45","2018-12-21 18:03:45","","984-991","","5","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","amygdala; bipolar disorder; dopamine beta-hydroxylase; dopamine transporter; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that baseline elevated plasma levels of the inflammatory biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP), associate with increased risk of late- and very-lateonset schizophrenia in the general population, and if such an association possibly is causal. Method: We analyzed data from 78 810 men and women, aged 20-100 years, from 2 large population studies. Endpoints were hospitalization with schizophrenia and schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis combined. We performed prospective and cross-sectional analyses adjusted for potential confounders with up to 20 years of follow-up. Furthermore, we used genetic variants influencing plasma CRP levels to perform a Mendelian randomization study. Results: Age-and gender-adjusted hazard ratios vs individuals in the first quartile of CRP were 1.7 (95% CI: 0.3-8.9) for second quartile, 2.1 (0.4-10) for third quartile, and 11 (2.8-40) for fourth quartile individuals. The corresponding hazard ratio for fourth quartile individuals after multifactorial adjustment was 5.9 (1.4-24). Furthermore, individuals with vs without schizophrenia had 63% increased plasma levels of CRP (P = 1 x 10(-4)). Finally, when CRP was on a continuous scale, a doubling in CRP yielded an age-and gender-adjusted observational OR of 1.5 (1.3-1.8) and a corresponding causal OR of 1.4 (0.5-4.3) (observed vs causal: P = .89). Conclusion: Baseline elevated plasma CRP is associated with a 6 -to 11-fold increased risk of late-and very-late-onset schizophrenia in the general population. We cannot exclude that this is a causal association.

Responding to a quartet of critical commentaries","IN℡LIGENCE","","0160-2896","10.1016/j.intell.2014.05.012","","Previously Woodley, te Nijenhuis and Murphy (2013) tested the hypothesis that Victorian era British and American samples exhibited higher g on average than relatively more modern populations sampled from the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Finland, using measures of simple visual reaction time in a meta-analytic study. Based on 13 age-matched studies from Western countries conducted between 1884 and 2004 yielding 16 data points we estimated a decline of -13.35 IQ points. Here we respond to a quartet of critical commentaries on our paper penned by five prominent intelligence researchers (James Flynn, Theodore Nettelbeck, Irwin Silverman, Julia Dodonova and Yuri Dodonov). We show via various reanalyses of the data and also via careful consideration of the arguments presented that the original finding of a potential secular decline in simple reaction time performance is robust. A recurrent criticism of our finding stems from earlier work showing no secular trends with respect to inspection time over a 20-year period in Australia despite the possibility of co-occurring dysgenic fertility. We deal with this via the method of correlated vectors, which reveals the presence of a `genetic g' common factor on which simple RTs, WAIS g loadings and subtest heritabilities load positively and significantly, but on which inspection time does not load. This indicates that inspection times are associated with local information processing, unlike simple reaction times, which are associated with global processing (i.e. g). The robustness of our original finding is best illustrated however by our final meta-regression, in which the use of six methods variance-controlled reaction time means taken from the US and the UK between 1889 and 1993, coupled with a newly-estimated age-matched reference standard deviation, reveal a seemingly robust secular trend towards slowing reaction time in these two countries, which translates into a potential dysgenics rate of -1.21 IQ points per decade, or -13.9 points in total between 1889 and 2004. We conclude by arguing that the best way forward is to test novel predictions stemming from our finding relating to molecular genetics, neurophysiology and alternative cognitive indicators, thus shifting the research focus away from the purely methodological level towards the broader nomological level. We thank our critics for helping us to arrive at a much more precise estimate of the decline in general intelligence.

Ninety-six women (who met at least one criterion for anorexia nervosa), completed a lab study in which they were randomly assigned to either a power or control condition. In the power condition, participants expected to have power over an ostensible partner. In the control condition, participants expected to work as equals. Under the guise of a taste-test cover story, participants then had the opportunity to consume a liquid test meal, which was weighed and served as the study's central dependent measure. Individual differences in perfectionism were measured with self-report questionnaires.

Previous research suggests that the ability to imagine desired outcomes can partially compensate when auditory feedback is absent, permitting continued performance even though information about whether these outcomes are realized is unavailable. Research also suggests that musical imagery ability improves with increasing musical expertise. This study tested the hypothesis that expert musicians' superior imagery abilities enable reduced reliance on auditory feedback, relative to novice musicians, during the performance of loudness changes (i.e., dynamics). Musicians reproduced the dynamic changes of sounded scales using a loudness slider as the availability of imagery and auditory feedback was manipulated. Contrary to expectations, only novices showed impairment in performing dynamics during imagery disruption and auditory feedback deprivation. Experts showed limited dependence on both sources of information, suggesting greater flexibility in how musical information is mentally represented, compared to novices, and an improved ability to adapt planning strategies.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:03:54","2018-12-21 18:03:54","","51-66","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","auditory feedback; expression; musical expertise; musical imagery; planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of electrophysiological responses - to predictable and unpredictable visual targets - to quantify the effective connectivity within and between cortical sources in the visual hierarchy in 25 schizophrenia patients and 25 age-matched controls. We found evidence for marked differences between normal subjects and schizophrenia patients in the strength of extrinsic backward connections from higher hierarchical levels to lower levels within the visual system. In addition, we show that not only do schizophrenia subjects have abnormal connectivity but also that they fail to adjust or optimize this connectivity when events can be predicted. Thus, the differential intrinsic recurrent connectivity observed during processing of predictable versus unpredictable targets was markedly attenuated in schizophrenia patients compared with controls, suggesting a failure to modulate the sensitivity of neurons responsible for passing sensory information of prediction errors up the visual cortical hierarchy. The findings support the proposed role of abnormal connectivity in the neuropathology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

Exposure to stress is also associated with mesolimbic dopamine release in individuals experiencing low maternal care. We therefore test the hypothesis that recent stressful life events are associated with more severe positive symptoms (associated with mesolimbic dopamine release) in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients who experienced low maternal care during childhood. We hypothesized that COMT Val(158) Met moderates this association. A total of 149 FEP patients recruited within the Psychosis Incident Cohort Outcome Study (PICOS) participated in the present study. Maternal care was assessed by the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), stressful life events were collected by the List of Events Scale and positive symptoms were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We found that low maternal care and recent stressful life events were associated with higher level of positive symptoms at the onset (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p=0.012), and that patients who were also homozygotes for the COMT Val(158) allele had the highest level of positive symptoms (ANOVA, p=0.024). Low maternal care and severe stressful life events may contribute to a symptomatology characterized by more severe positive symptoms at the onset, possibly due to an increased mesolimbic dopamine release. Homozygosity for the COMT Val(158) allele seems to confer a biological predisposition to the stress-related hyperactivity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. The data imply that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is involved in the mediation/ modulation of the effect of stressful events on the vulnerability for psychosis.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:03:56","2018-12-21 18:03:56","","410-415","","5","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","COMT; first-episode psychosis; parental bonding; stressful events","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attentional Control Theory proposes such deficiencies may be offset when demands on resources are increased to execute goals. To test the hypothesis attentional demands affect ACC response 23 patients with gSAD and 24 matched controls performed an fMRI task involving a target letter in a string of identical targets (low load) or a target letter in a mixed letter string (high load) superimposed on fearful, angry, and neutral face distractors. Regardless of load condition, groups were similar in accuracy and reaction time. Under low load gSAD patients showed deficient rostral ACC recruitment to fearful (vs. neutral) distractors. For high load, increased activation to fearful (vs. neutral) distractors was observed in gSAD suggesting a compensatory function. Results remained after controlling for group differences in depression level. Findings indicate perceptual demand modulates ACC in gSAD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The current study tested the hypothesis that experimentally increasing interoceptive accuracy should decrease symptom severity in somatoform disorders. Twenty-nine patients with somatoform disorders were instructed in a newly developed heartbeat perception training procedure. Heartbeat perception, as a proxy for interoceptive accuracy, was assessed with a mental tracking task. Although there were no significant differences between the training group and a waiting control group (n = 23) regarding increases in heartbeat perception, health anxiety served as a moderator and significant reductions in state symptom reports were observed after training.

In this view, schizotypy is a psychological phenotype oriented toward high mating effort and reduced parenting, consistent with a fast life history strategy, whereas autistic-like traits contribute to a slow strategy characterized by reduced mating effort and high parental investment. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that autistic-like and schizotypal traits would be diametrically associated with unrestricted sociosexuality, impulsivity, and sensation seeking (three key behavioral correlates of fast life history strategies in humans) in a sample of 152 young adults (18-38 years). The results were consistent with a diametrical autism-schizotypy axis of individual variation. In line with our hypotheses, autism-schizotypy scores were uniquely associated with individual differences in impulsivity, sensation seeking, and sociosexual behavior, even after controlling for variation in Big Five personality traits. However, we found no significant associations with sociosexual attitude in the present sample. Our findings provide additional support for a life history model of autistic-like and schizotypal traits and demonstrate the heuristic value of this approach in the study of personality and psychopathology.

Methods: Data were collected from 252 colorectal cancer patients from academic and community oncology practices in Virginia and Ohio. We used a cross-sectional, mixed methods design collected data through patient interviews and medical record reviews. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested the hypothesized relationships between symptoms, financial and cognitive barriers and patient care seeking delays. Results: In bivariate analyses, patients who reported a financial barrier to accessing health care (t(246) = -2.6, p < 0.01) were more likely to have greater care-seeking delays. Model testing revealed that experiencing cognitive barriers was a significant, positive, direct predictor of appraisal delay (0.35; p < 0.01). Indirect pathways from symptoms (0.07; p < 0.05) and financial barriers (0.09; p< 0.05) to appraisal delay via cognitive barriers were significant. Conclusions: Patient interpretations of symptoms were influenced by financial barriers. Conceptualizing financial barriers as a component of the symptom appraisal process is conceptually different from viewing it as only a structural barrier preventing healthcare access. Implications for practice These findings extend our understanding of why and how patients seemingly ignore serious symptoms, which hamper physician ability to provide curative therapy. In addition to uninsured patients, this may have important implications for the treatment and care of those who are underinsured.

Less is known about the relative efficacy of different response formats during testing. We tested the hypothesis that overt testing (typing responses on a keyboard) during a practice phase benefits later memory more than covert testing (only pressing a button to indicate successful retrieval). In Experiment 1, three groups learned 40 word pairs either by repeatedly studying them, by studying and overtly testing them, or by studying and covertly testing them. In Experiment 2, only the two testing conditions were manipulated in a within-subjects design. In both experiments, participants received cued recall tests after a short (similar to 19 min) and a long (1 week) retention interval. In Experiment 1, all groups performed equally well at the short retention interval. The overt testing group reliably outperformed the repeated study group after 1 week, whereas the covert testing group performed insignificantly different from both these groups. Hence, the testing effect was demonstrated for overt, but failed to show for covert testing. In Experiment 2, overtly tested items were better and more quickly retrieved than those covertly tested. Further, this does not seem to be due to any differences in retrieval effort during learning. To conclude, overt testing was more beneficial for later retention than covert testing, but the effect size was small. Possible explanations are discussed.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:04:00","2018-12-21 18:04:00","","623-633","","5","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to compare the specific temperament features and clinical features of BD patients with and without a history of suicide attempt (SA) to test the hypothesis that depressive, cyclothymic and irritable temperament scores are higher in bipolar patients with suicide history. Methods: We enrolled a total of 100 patients, 50 of them with a history of SA, 50 without at Bakirkoy Training and Research Hospital for Psychiatry, Neurology and Neurosurgery. All patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR criteria for `bipolar disorder in remission' and signed a written informed consent before study entry. Sociodemographic data were collected and temperament was assessed by the means of TEMPS-A. Results: Depressive, cyclothymic and irritable temperament scores were significantly higher in BD patients with SA than in those without. Moreover cigarette and alcohol consumption, family history for psychiatric illness, presence of other psychiatric disorders, history of childhood trauma, episode duration, history of hypo/manic switch were also significantly higher in the group with than without SA. Discussion: Our study confirmed other findings reported in the literature on risk factors associated with suicide behavior. In addition, we also found that depressive, cyclothymic and irritable temperament scores are higher in patients with SA. The assessment of temperament could be added in the evaluation of patients in order to predict possible suicide behavior.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:04:01","2018-12-21 18:04:01","","214-220","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","Turkish","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; suicide; temperament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insight, positive and negative symptoms, hope, depression and self-stigma are relevant variables in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. So far, research on their mutual influences has been patchy. This study simultaneously tests the associations between these variables. Methods. A total of 284 people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were assessed using the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Integrative Hope Scale, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale. Path analysis was applied to test the hypothesized relationships between the variables. Results. Model support was excellent. Strong and mutual causal influences were confirmed between hope, depression and self-stigma. The model supported the assumption that insight diminishes hope and increases depression and self-stigma. While negative symptoms directly affected these three variables, reducing hope and increasing depression and self-stigma, positive symptoms did not. However, positive symptoms diminished self-stigma on a pathway via insight. Conclusions. This study provides a comprehensive synopsis of the relationships between six variables relevant for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Research implications include the need to investigate determinants of consequences of insight, and the sequence of influences exerted by positive and negative symptoms. Clinical implications include the importance of interventions against self-stigma and of taking a contextualized approach to insight.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:04:02","2018-12-21 18:04:02","","271-279","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Insight; path modelling; schizophrenia spectrum disorders; self-stigma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that non-invasive prefrontal stimulation would change neural activity in crack-cocaine addiction, investigating the effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) of Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) induced cortical excitability modulation on the visual P3 Event Related Potentials (ERP) component under neutral and drug cue exposition in crack-cocaine addicts. Thirteen crack-cocaine users were randomly distributed to receive five applications (once a day, every other day) of bilateral (left cathodal/right anodal) tDCS (20 min, 2 mA, 35 cm(2)) or sham tDCS over the DLPFC. Brain activity was measured under crack-related or neutral visual-cued ERPs. There were significant differences in P3-related parameters when comparing group of stimulation (active vs. sham tDCS) and number of sessions (single vs. repetitive tDCS). After a single session of tDCS, P3 current intensity in the left DLPFC increased during neutral cues and decreased during crack-related cues. This effect was opposite to what was observed in the sham-tDCS group. In contrast, repetitive tDCS increased current density not only in the DLPFC, but also in a wider array of prefrontal areas, including presumably the frontopolar cortex (FPC) orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when subjects were visualizing crack-related cues. Thus, single and repetitive application of tDCS can impact cognitive processing of neutral and especially crack-related visual cues in prefrontal areas, which may be of importance for treatment of crack-cocaine addiction.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:04:03","2018-12-21 18:04:03","","1465-1475","","9","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Crack-cocaine; cue-reactivity; event-related potential; prefrontal cortex; tDCS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests the hypothesis that neighborhood collective efficacy attenuates the relationship between adolescent exposure to violence, substance use, and violence. Data were collected from 1,661 to 1,718 adolescents participating in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, who were diverse in terms of sex (51 % male, 49 % female), race/ethnicity (48 % Hispanic, 34 % African American, 14 % Caucasian, and 4 % other race/ethnicity), and age (mean age 12 years; range 8-16). Information on neighborhood collective efficacy was obtained from adult residents, and data from the 1990 US. Census were used to control for neighborhood disadvantage. Based on hierarchical modeling techniques to adjust for the clustered data, Bernoulli models indicated that more exposure to violence was associated with a greater likelihood of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use and perpetration of violence. Poisson models suggested that victimization was also related to a greater variety of substance use and violent behaviors. A moderating effect of collective efficacy was found in models assessing the variety of substance use; the relationship between victimization and substance use was weaker for youth in neighborhoods with higher versus lower levels of collective efficacy. These findings are consistent with literature indicating that social support can ameliorate the negative impact of victimization. This investigation extends this research to show that neighborhood social support can also help to promote resiliency among adolescents.","2014-09","2018-12-21 18:04:04","2018-12-21 18:04:04","","1498-1512","","9, SI","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Collective efficacy; Exposure to violence; Neighborhoods; Substance use; Victimization; Violence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test the hypothesis that deficits in emotion identification and expression result from, or are at least related to, deficits in neurocognition and affective symptoms, we assessed alexithymia using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and neurocognition using the MATRICS battery among 65 adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in a non-acute phase of illness. Partial correlations controlling for the effects of social desirability revealed that difficulty identifying feelings and externally oriented thinking were linked with greater levels of neurocognitive deficits, while difficulty describing feelings was related to heightened levels of emotional distress. To explore whether neurocognition and affective symptoms were uniquely related to alexithymia, a multiple regression was conducted in which neurocognitive scores and affective symptoms were allowed to enter to predict overall levels of alexithymia after controlling for social desirability. Results revealed both processing speed and anxiety uniquely contributed to the prediction of the total score on the TAS-20. Results suggest that dysfunctions in both cognitive and affective processes may be related to alexithymia in schizophrenia independently of one another.

One hundred fifty-three outpatients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) who presented for treatment or who were in ongoing treatment and had their medication changed due to lack of efficacy completed the Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale (CUDOS), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) and Remission from Depression Questionnaire (RDQ) at the initiation of treatment and 4 month follow-up. The patients were evaluated with the 17-item Hamilton Depression scale (HAMD). The CUDOS and RDQ were equally highly correlated with the HAMD at baseline and follow-up. There was no significant difference in the correlations between the modified and original scoring algorithms of the QIDS with the HAMD at baseline and the follow-up. On each scale, the patients showed significant levels of improvement from baseline to 4 months, and the effect sizes were similar. These findings suggest that the loss of information due to the scoring rules of the QIDS or the rating format of the RDQ did not reduce the validity of depression severity assessment.

A subtle way to influence object evaluation is through eye gaze: Objects looked at by others are perceived as more likable than objects that are not looked at. In 3 experiments, we directly tested the hypothesis that this liking effect depends on the processing of the intentional relation between other's eye gaze and the object being looked at. To this end, we used a novel paradigm in which participants observed a face looking left or right behind an opaque barrier. Under all tested conditions, we found a gaze cueing effect on attention: Looked-at objects were categorized faster than looked-away objects. In contrast, observed gaze only led to a boost in affective evaluation for the target object when observers had the impression that the face could see the object behind the barrier, but not when observers had the impression that the face could not see the object. These findings indicate that observers make a sophisticated use of social gaze cues in the affective evaluation of objects: Objects looked at by others are liked more than objects looked away but only when others can see the objects.","2014-08","2018-12-21 18:04:08","2018-12-21 18:04:08","","824-832","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","gaze cueing; intentional gaze; liking effect; object desirability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tested the hypothesis that a multiagent report of adolescents' effortful control (age 17) would be predictive of academic persistence and educational attainment (age 23-25), after controlling for other established predictors (family factors, problem behavior, grade-point average, and substance use). Participants were 997 students recruited in 6th grade from 3 urban public middle schools (53% males; 42.4% European American; 29.2% African American). Consistent with the hypothesis, the unique association of effortful control with future educational attainment was comparable in strength to that of parental education and students' past grade-point average, suggesting that effortful control contributes to this outcome above and beyond well-established predictors. Path coefficients were equivalent across gender and ethnicity (European Americans and African Americans). Effortful control appears to be a core feature of the self-regulatory competencies associated with achievement of educational success in early adulthood. These findings suggest that the promotion of self-regulation in general and effortful control in particular may be an important focus not only for resilience to stress and avoidance of problem behavior but also for growth in academic competence.","2014-08","2018-12-21 18:04:09","2018-12-21 18:04:09","","730-743","","3","106","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","academic achievement; adolescence; educational attainment level; family background; self-regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants read coordination descriptions and saw two colored lines that matched the descriptions. Two figures then selected the lines either by moving jointly along them or by standing each on a different line. Moving selections yielded high validation scores in conjunction trials and low validation scores in disjunction trials, whereas stationary selections yielded mitigated scores. The results demonstrate that jointly moving stimuli, which are effective cues to visual grouping, help retrieve and validate conjunction simulations composed of dependent stimuli as well as retrieve and invalidate disjunction simulations composed of independent stimuli. These findings challenge accounts based on truth-condition satisfaction that stimuli properties cannot affect language comprehension and thereby reasoning.","2014-08","2018-12-21 18:04:10","2018-12-21 18:04:10","","397-403","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Conjunction; Coordination; Disjunction; Motion-defined objects; Reasoning; Simulation; Truth conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the past 2 decades, increasing numbers of children and adolescents have been diagnosed as having BD. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have begun to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying BD, few have directly compared differences in youths with BD and adults with BD (hereafter BD-youths and BD-adults, respectively). OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that BD-youths (<18 years old) would show greater convergence of amygdala hyperactivation and prefrontal cortical hypoactivation vs BD-adults. DATA SOURCES PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched on July 17, 2013, for original, task-related coordinate-based fMRI articles. STUDY SELECTION In total, 21 pediatric studies, 73 adult studies, and 2 studies containing distinct pediatric and adult groups within the same study met inclusion criteria for our ALE analyses. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Coordinates of significant between-group differences were extracted from each published study. Recent improvements in GingerALE software were used to perform direct comparisons of pediatric and adult fMRI findings. We conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses directly comparing the voxelwise convergence of fMRI findings in BD-youths vs BD-adults, both relative to healthy control (HC) participants. RESULTS Analyses of emotional face recognition fMRI studies showed significantly greater convergence of amygdala hyperactivation among BD-youths than BD-adults. More broadly, analyses of fMRI studies using emotional stimuli showed significantly greater convergence of hyperactivation among BD-youths than BD-adults in the inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus. In contrast, analyses of fMRI studies using nonemotional cognitive tasks and analyses aggregating emotional and nonemotional tasks showed significantly greater convergence of hypoactivation among BD-youths than BD-adults in the anterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our data suggest that amygdala, prefrontal, and visual system hyperactivation is important in the emotional dysfunction present in BD-youths, as well as that anterior cingulate cortex hypoactivation is relevant to the cognitive deficits in BD-youths. Future studies are required to determine if the developmental fMRI differences between BD-youths and BD-adults identified by our ALE meta-analyses are useful as brain-based diagnostic or treatment markers of BD, including either longitudinal neuroimaging studies of BD-youths as they become adults or cross-sectional imaging studies directly comparing BD-youths with BD-adults.","2014-08","2018-12-21 18:04:10","2018-12-21 18:04:10","","926-935","","8","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also associated with abnormal gaze behaviors toward others: individuals with schizophrenia usually look less to others' face and gaze, which are crucial epistemic cues that contribute to correct mental states inferences. This study tests the hypothesis that impaired ToM in schizophrenia might be related to a deficit in visual attention toward gaze orientation. We adapted a previous non-verbal ToM paradigm consisting of animated cartoons allowing the assessment of goal and belief attribution. In the true and false belief conditions, an object was displaced while an agent was either looking at it or away, respectively. Eye movements were recorded to quantify visual attention to gaze orientation (proportion of time participants spent looking at the head of the agent while the target object changed locations). 29 patients with schizophrenia and 29 matched controls were tested. Compared to controls, patients looked significantly less at the agent's head and had lower performance in belief and goal attribution. Performance in belief and goal attribution significantly increased with the head looking percentage. When the head looking percentage was entered as a covariate, the group effect on belief and goal attribution performance was not significant anymore. Patients' deficit on this visual ToM paradigm is thus entirely explained by a decreased visual attention toward gaze. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In Experiment 1, participants made saccadic eye movements to equiprobable peripheral and central targets. At short cue-target onset asynchronies (CTOAs), responses to cued peripheral stimuli suffered from slowed responding attributable to sensory adaptation while responses to central targets were transiently facilitated, presumably due to cue-elicited oculomotor activation. At the longest CTOA, saccadic responses to central and peripheral targets were indistinguishably delayed, suggesting a common, output/decision effect (inhibition of return; IOR). In Experiment 2, we tested the hypothesis that the generation of this output effect is dependent on the activation state of the oculomotor system by forbidding eye movements and requiring keypress responses to frequent peripheral targets, while probing oculomotor behavior with saccades to infrequent central arrow targets. As predicted, saccades to central arrow targets showed neither the early facilitation nor later inhibitory effects that were robust in Experiment 1. At the long CTOA, manual responses to cued peripheral targets showed the typical delayed responses usually attributed to IOR. We recommend that this late “inhibitory” cueing effect (ICE) be distinguished from IOR because it lacks the cause (oculomotor activation) and effect (response bias) attributed to IOR when it was named by Posner, Rafal, Choate, and Vaughan (1985).

Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that expectation biases arise from feature-level predictions that enhance early sensory representations and facilitate evidence accumulation for contextually probable stimuli while suppressing alternatives. Reasonably then, the extent to which prior knowledge biases subsequent sensory processing should depend on the precision of expectations at the feature level as well as the degree to which expected features match those of an observed stimulus. In the present study we investigated how these two sources of uncertainty modulated pre- and post-stimulus bias mechanisms in the drift-diffusion model during a probabilistic face/house discrimination task. We tested several plausible models of choice bias, concluding that predictive cues led to a bias in both the starting-point and rate of evidence accumulation favoring the more probable stimulus category. We further tested the hypotheses that prior bias in the starting-point was conditional on the feature-level uncertainty of category expectations and that dynamic bias in the drift-rate was modulated by the match between expected and observed stimulus features. Starting-point estimates suggested that subjects formed a constant prior bias in favor of the face category, which exhibits less feature-level variability, that was strengthened or weakened by trial-wise predictive cues. Furthermore, we found that the gain on face/house evidence was increased for stimuli with less ambiguous features and that this relationship was enhanced by valid category expectations. These findings offer new evidence that bridges psychological models of decision-making with recent predictive coding theories of perception. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Two dimensions of effortful control (executive control and delay ability) were assessed at four time points, each separated by nine months, and growth trajectories were examined. Maternal warmth, negativity, limit setting, scaffolding, and responsiveness were observed. Above the effects of child cognitive ability, income, and cumulative risk, scaffolding predicted higher initial levels of executive control that remained higher across the study, and limit setting predicted greater gains in executive control. Parenting did not predict changes in delay ability. Significant indirect effects indicated that scaffolding mediated the effects of income and cumulative risk on growth in executive control.

As these trends require adequate explanation, we tested the hypothesis that decreasing trial-dropout rates may be an important contributor. We gathered reports of peer-reviewed, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants (1980-2011) by computerized literature searching, and applied meta-analysis, meta-regression and multiple linear regression methods to evaluate associations of dropout rates and other factors of interest, to reporting year and reported efficacy [standardized mean drug-placebo difference (SMD) as Hedges' g-statistic]. In 56 trials meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, we confirmed significant overall efficacy of antidepressants but declining drug-placebo contrasts over the past three decades. Among other changes, there was a corresponding increase in placebo-associated improvement with a decline in placebo-dropout rate, mainly for lack of efficacy. These effects were found only when last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analyses were used. Other trial-design and subject factors, including drug-responses and drug-dropout rates, were much less associated with efficacy. We propose that declining placebo-dropout rates ascribed to inefficacy combined with use of LOCF analyses led to increasing improvement in placebo-arms that contributed to declining antidepressant-placebo contrasts in controlled treatment trials since the 1980s.","2014-08","2018-12-21 18:04:22","2018-12-21 18:04:22","","1343-1352","","8","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Antidepressants; efficacy; placebo responses; randomized controlled trials; trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The common mental disorders (CMDs) of anxiety and depression are the most common form of poor mental health in the general population. Evidence from the small number of previous cohort studies on the role of neighbourhood factors in mental health is inconclusive. We tested the hypothesis that high levels of neighbourhood social cohesion modify an adverse association between change in individual mental health and neighbourhood deprivation. Method. We carried out a longitudinal multilevel analysis using data from the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Cohort Study with a 7-year follow-up (n=4426; age range 18-74 years at baseline). Neighbourhood deprivation and neighbourhood social cohesion were assessed at baseline and change in mental health between follow-up and baseline was assessed using the five-item Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). Results. Residence in the most deprived neighbourhoods was negatively associated with change in mental health, after adjusting for baseline individual socio-economic risk factors and transitions in life events. This negative effect was significantly reduced in high social cohesion neighbourhoods. The predicted change in mental health score was calculated for the 10th and 90th centiles of the household low-income distribution. The difference between them was -2.8 in the low social cohesion group and 1.1 in the high cohesion group. The difference between the groups was 3.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-7.6]. Conclusions. The public health burden of poor mental health and mental health inequality could potentially be reduced by strengthening social cohesion in deprived neighbourhoods. This offers a mechanism to address the adverse effect of neighbourhood deprivation on population mental health.","2014-08","2018-12-21 18:04:23","2018-12-21 18:04:23","","2449-2460","","11","44","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Epidemiology; longitudinal studies; mental health; social environment; social medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the few behavioral studies that examined effects of arousal have produced inconsistent findings. The present study manipulated the arousal of pictorial stimuli to test the hypothesis that preserved emotional functioning in aging is modulated by the level of arousal, and to identify the associated neural correlates. Young and older healthy participants were presented with negative and neutral pictures, which they rated for emotional content, while fMRI data were recorded. There were three main novel findings regarding the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of negative pictures with different levels of arousal in young and older adults. First, the common engagement of the right amygdala in young and older adults was driven by high arousing negative stimuli. Second, complementing an age-related reduction in the subjective ratings for low arousing negative pictures, there were opposing patterns of activity in the rostral/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala, which showed increased vs. decreased responses, respectively, to low arousing negative pictures. Third, increased spontaneous activity in the ventral ACC/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in older adults was linked to reduced ratings for low arousing negative pictures. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of the neural correlates underlying processing of negative emotions with different levels of arousal in the context of enhanced emotional functioning in healthy aging. Notably, the results support the idea that older adults have emotion regulation networks chronically activated, in the absence of explicit induction of the goal to regulate emotions, and that this effect is specific to low arousing negative emotions.","2014-07-28","2018-12-21 18:04:25","2018-12-21 18:04:25","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","brain imaging; emotion control; spontaneous emotion regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While past experiences are believed to influence efficacy beliefs, the explanations individuals provide for these experiences also may be critical. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that perceived success or failure to accumulate 150min of physical activity in the previous week would moderate the relationship between the attributional dimension of stability and self-efficacy to exercise in the future. Forty-two adults with MS participated in this cross-sectional descriptive study. Participants completed questions assessing physical activity, perceived outcome for meeting the recommended level of endurance activity, attributions for the outcome, and exercise self-efficacy. Results from hierarchical multiple regression revealed a significant main effect for perceived outcome predicting self-efficacy that was qualified by a significant interaction. The final model, which included perceived outcome, stability, and the interaction term, predicted 37% of the variance in exercise self-efficacy, F (3, 38) = 7.27, p=.001. Our findings suggest that the best prediction of self-efficacy in the MS population may include the interaction of specific attributional dimensions with success/failure at meeting the recommended physical activity dose. Attributions may be another target for interventions aimed at increasing the physical activity in MS.","2014-07-04","2018-12-21 18:04:26","2018-12-21 18:04:26","","433-441","","4","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","exercise; multiple sclerosis; self-assessment; self-efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measures of these constructs were administered to 273 college student volunteers recruited from a larger pool of students in classes and via e-mail solicitation, and the model was analyzed using structural equation modelling. As hypothesized, generalized self-efficacy, positive thoughts, and negative thoughts fully mediated the conscientiousness-MIL relationship. The model accounted for 45% of the variance in MIL, 34% of the variance in positive thoughts, 27% of the variance in negative thoughts, and 35% of the variance in generalized self-efficacy.

Evidence of Attenuated Effects in US Latinas","CULTURAL DIVERSITY & ETHNIC MINORITY PSYCHOLOGY","","1099-9809","10.1037/a0035329","","Neuroticism is the heritable and stable personality trait defined by the tendency to experience negative emotion, be easily stressed, and slow to soothe. Neuroticism poses a risk for poor social and health outcomes that has been identified as a major public health concern. To date, factors that attenuate neuroticism's costs have not been identified. The goal of this work was to test the hypothesis that the costs of neuroticism would be attenuated in sociocultural contexts that emphasize readily accessible social support, emotional positivity, and physical proximity in interdependent relationships. U.S. Latino culture fits these characteristics. Two studies, an online survey study (Study 1) and a laboratory study (Study 2), tested whether three key costs of high neuroticism-less support (Study 1), more distress (Study 2), and blunted cortisol reactivity (Study 2)-would be attenuated in U.S. Latinas relative to non-Latinas of European and East Asian cultural background. Consistent with previous research, neuroticism was associated with less perceived support, more distress, and blunted cortisol reactivity in non-Latina women of European and East Asian cultural background. For Latina women, however, these effects were attenuated. Latina women who were high in neuroticism continued to feel supported, were not as distressed, and their cortisol reactivity was less blunted. The role of sociocultural context for generating a better understanding of personality processes and the social malleability of neuroticism's costs are discussed.","2014-07","2018-12-21 18:04:29","2018-12-21 18:04:29","","430-440","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cortisol reactivity; culture; health; neuroticism; social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this traditional cue approach neglects the role of the observer's body beyond mere visual comparison. In a previous study, we used a full-body illusion to show that objects appear larger and farther away when participants experience a small artificial body as their own and that objects appear smaller and closer when they assume ownership of a large artificial body (”Barbie-doll illusion”; van der Hoort, Guterstam, & Ehrsson, PLoS ONE, 6(5), e20195, 2011). The first aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that this own-body-size effect is distinct from the role of the seen body as a direct familiar-size cue. To this end, we developed a novel setup that allowed for occlusion of the artificial body during the presentation of test objects. Our results demonstrate that the feeling of ownership of an artificial body can alter the perceived sizes of objects without the need for a visible body. Second, we demonstrate that fixation shifts do not contribute to the own-body-size effect. Third, we show that the effect exists in both peri-personal space and distant extra-personal space. Finally, through a meta-analysis, we demonstrate that the own-body-size effect is independent of and adds to the classical visual familiar-size cue effect. Our results suggest that, by changing body size, the entire spatial layout rescales and new objects are now perceived according to this rescaling, without the need to see the body.","2014-07","2018-12-21 18:04:31","2018-12-21 18:04:31","","1414-1428","","5","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","3D perception; Cue integration; Illusion; Multisensory processing; Visual perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Study 2, we provide a replication of the relation between mind wandering and performance over time found in Study 1, using a Flanker interference task.

No such association was expected for more avoidantly attached individuals. Method: A group of 119 patients with different types of cancer (breast, cervical, intestinal and prostate) completed questionnaires concerning trust (short version of the Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale) and attachment (Experiences in Close Relationship scale Revised) at 3 months after diagnosis.

More recently, self-compassion has been discussed as another potentially effective strategy for coping with depression. In the present study, we compared the effectiveness of self-compassion with a waiting condition, reappraisal, and acceptance in a clinically depressed sample, and tested the hypothesis that the intensity of depressed mood would moderate the differential efficacy of these strategies. In an experimental design, we induced depressed mood at four points in time in 48 participants meeting criteria for major depressive disorder. After each mood induction, participants were instructed to wait, reappraise the situation, accept their negative emotions, or employ self-compassion to regulate their depressed mood. Self-ratings of depressed mood were assessed before and after each mood induction and regulation phase. Results showed that the reduction of depressed mood was significantly greater in the self-compassion condition than in the waiting condition. No significant differences were observed between the self-compassion and the reappraisal condition, and between the self-compassion and the acceptance condition in patients' mood ratings. However, the intensity of self-rated depressed mood at baseline was found to moderate the comparative effectiveness of self-compassion and reappraisal with a trend of self-compassion being more effective than reappraisal in high depressed mood at baseline. These findings support the use of self-compassion as another adaptive emotion regulation strategy for patients with major depressive disorder, especially for those suffering from high levels of depressed mood.

Specifically, we examined whether improvements in working memory maintenance and manipulation from childhood to early adulthood predicted the reduction of ADHD symptoms as a function of allelic variation in DRD1 and DRD2. Participants were 76 7-11-year-old children with ADHD who were genotyped and prospectively followed for almost 10 years. ADHD symptoms were rated using the Attention Problems scale on the Child Behavior Checklist, and verbal working memory maintenance and manipulation, measured by Digit Span forward and backward, respectively, were assessed at baseline and follow-up. After correction for multiple testing, improvements in working memory manipulation, not maintenance, predicted reduction of symptomatology over development and was moderated by major allele homozygosity in two DRD1 polymorphisms (rs4532 and rs265978) previously linked with variation in D1 receptor expression. Depending on genetic background, developmental factors including age-dependent variation in DRD1 penetrance may facilitate the link between improvements in higher-order working memory and the remission of symptoms in individuals with childhood-diagnosed ADHD. Furthermore, the current findings suggest that DRD1 might contribute minimally to the emergence of symptoms and cognitive difficulties associated with ADHD in childhood, but may act as a modifier gene of these clinical features and outcome during later development for those with ADHD.","2014-07","2018-12-21 18:04:34","2018-12-21 18:04:34","","584-595","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study tests the hypothesis that CAM use is associated with intentional lapses in adherence (e.g., “medication vacations”), perhaps due to negative beliefs about antiretroviral therapy (ART). Method: Cross-sectional interviews with 116 PLWHA were completed using a computerized assessment of self-reported CAM use and ART adherence. Results: Almost half of participants used CAM to treat or manage HIV-related health concerns in the past month, and 78% had used CAM since being diagnosed with HIV. Seventy-one percent of participants endorsed at least one domain of intentional nonadherence since starting HIV treatment. As hypothesized, CAM users did not differ from nonusers on overall ART adherence. Contrary to hypotheses, CAM users were less likely to report taking medication vacations or having stopped taking HIV medications without their doctor's approval compared with nonusers. CAM intensity was also related to intentional nonadherence, such that patients who engaged in more CAM tended to report fewer skipped doses and fewer nonprescribed adjustments to their medication regimen in the past month. Conclusions: Findings suggest that PLWHA use CAM as an adjunct to ART and that CAM use does not undermine ART adherence. Needed now is longitudinal research to determine how a proactive, holistic approach to HIV care interacts with conventional HIV treatment over time, and whether CAM use impacts long-term quality of life and health outcomes.","2014-07","2018-12-21 18:04:35","2018-12-21 18:04:35","","660-667","","7","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adherence; alternative medicine; CAM; complementary medicine; HIV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the integration of gesture information in an abstract sentence context (metaphoric gestures), intact connectivity between the left STS and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) should be important. Patients with schizophrenia have problems with the processing of metaphors (concretism) and show aberrant structural connectivity of long fiber bundles. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia differ in the functional connectivity of the left STS to the IFG for the processing of metaphoric gestures. During functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition, 16 patients with schizophrenia (P) and a healthy control group (C) were shown videos of an actor performing gestures in a concrete (iconic, IC) and abstract (metaphoric, MP) sentence context. A psychophysiological interaction analysis based on the seed region from a previous analysis in the left STS was performed. In both groups we found common positive connectivity for IC and MP of the STS seed region to the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and left ventral IFG. The interaction of group (C>P) and gesture condition (MP>IC) revealed effects in the connectivity to the bilateral IFG and the left MTG with patients exhibiting lower connectivity for the MP condition. In schizophrenia the left STS is mis-connected to the IFG, particularly during the processing of MP gestures. Dysfunctional integration of gestures in an abstract sentence context might be the basis of certain interpersonal communication problems in the patients.","2014-07","2018-12-21 18:04:36","2018-12-21 18:04:36","","936-944","","4","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","concretism; coverbal gestures; fMRI; integration; psychophysiological interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we tested the hypothesis that known genetic and environmental risk conditions may heighten infants' natural tendency to attend to threat-alerting stimuli, resulting in a cognitive bias that may contribute to emotional vulnerability. Methods Data from two samples of 5-7-month-old infants (N=139) were used to examine whether established candidate variations in the serotonin-system genes, i.e., TPH2 SNP rs4570625 (-703G/T) and HTR1A SNP rs6295 (-1019G/C), and early rearing condition (maternal stress and depressive symptoms) are associated with alterations in infants' attention to facial expressions. Infants were tested with a paradigm that assesses the ability to disengage attention from a centrally presented stimulus (a nonface control stimulus or a neutral, happy, or fearful facial expression) toward the location of a new stimulus in the visual periphery (a geometric shape). Results TPH2 -703 T-carrier genotype (i.e., TT homozygotes and heterozygotes), presence of maternal stress and depressive symptoms, and a combination of the T-carrier genotype and maternal depressive symptoms were associated with a relatively greater difficulty disengaging attention from fearful facial expressions.

However, the motive to regard the self as an object is not well understood. The current research tested the hypothesis that literal self-objectification can serve a terror management function. From this perspective, the female body poses a unique existential threat on account of its role in reproduction, and regarding the self as an object is posited to shield women from this threat because objects, in contrast to humans, are not mortal. Across 5 studies, 3 operationalizations of literal self-objectification were employed (a denial of essentially human traits to the self, overlap in the explicit assignment of traits to the self and objects, and implicit associations between self and objects using an implicit association test) in response to 3 aspects of women's bodies involved in reproduction (pregnancy, menstruation, and breastfeeding). In each study, priming mortality led women (but not men, included in Studies 1, 3, 4, and 5) to literally self-objectify in conditions where women's reproductive features were salient. In addition, literal self-objectification was found to mediate subsequent responsiveness to death-related stimuli (Study 4). Together, these findings are the first to demonstrate a direct link between mortality salience, women's role in reproduction, and their self-objectification, supporting an existential function of self-objectification in women.","2014-07","2018-12-21 18:04:38","2018-12-21 18:04:38","","181-198","","1","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","breastfeeding; literal self-objectification; menstruation; pregnancy; terror management theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests the hypothesis that low resting heart rate will be associated with aggression and psychopathic traits, and that heart rate will interact with adversity in predisposing to these antisocial traits. Resting heart rate was assessed in 334 Hong Kong male and female schoolchildren aged 11-17 years. A social adversity index was calculated from a psychosocial interview of the parent, while parents assessed their children on the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire and the Antisocial Personality Screening Device. Low resting heart rate was significantly associated with higher proactive aggression, impulsive features of psychopathy, and total child psychopathy. Low resting heart rate interacted with high psychosocial adversity in explaining higher reactive (but not proactive) aggression, as well as impulsive psychopathy. These findings provide support for a biosocial perspective of reactive aggression and impulsive psychopathy, and document low resting heart rate as a robust correlate of both childhood impulsive psychopathic behavior and proactive aggression. To our knowledge, this study is the first to document low resting heart rate as a correlate of child psychopathy and the second to establish low heart rate as a risk factor of antisocial behavior in an East Asian population. The findings provide further evidence for both low resting heart rate as a potential biomarker for childhood psychopathic and aggressive behavior, and also a biosocial perspective on childhood antisocial behavior.

Values relating to adolescent development and the transition to adulthood were compared across three generations of women in 18 families in the Maya community of Zinacantan in southern Mexico. Grandmothers grew up in Zinacantan when it was a farming community; mothers grew up during the introduction of commerce in the late 1970s and 1980s; daughters are now experiencing adolescence with an opportunity to attend high school in their community. Comparisons were also conducted between 40 female and male adolescents in high school and a matched sample of 40 adolescents who discontinued school after elementary. Values were measured using eight ethnographically derived social dilemmas about adolescent relationships with parents and peers, work and family gender roles, and sexuality and partnering. One character in the dilemmas advocates for interdependent values; a second character advocates for independent values. High school adolescents were more likely to endorse characters articulating independent values than non-high school adolescents, mothers, and grandmothers. Involvement in a market economy was also associated with higher levels of independent value endorsement in the mother and grandmother generations. Results suggest that the introduction of commerce drove value changes between grandmother and mother generations, and now schooling drives change. Qualitative examples of participants' responses also illustrate how families negotiate shifting values.","2014-07","2018-12-21 18:04:40","2018-12-21 18:04:40","","868-887","","6","45","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescence; autonomy; culture change; gender roles; independence; interdependence; relatedness; sexuality; transition to adulthood; values","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study used three waves of data to evaluate a family stress model in which economic hardship is indirectly related to adolescent problem drinking through maternal psychological distress, parenting behaviors, and adolescent externalizing behaviors. Respondents included 300 mothers (71 % Black, 29 % White) and adolescents (51 % male) who were interviewed when adolescents were ages 10, 14, and 16. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model and findings supported our hypothesized model. Economic hardship was positively related to maternal psychological distress. Maternal psychological distress was negatively associated with supportive parenting, which in turn was negatively associated with externalizing problems. Externalizing problems were positively associated with problem drinking. In support of our hypothesis regarding indirect effects, economic hardship was indirectly related to problem drinking through maternal psychological distress, parenting behaviors, and adolescent externalizing problems.

Study 2 (N = 88) provided further evidence that affect- and value-related interest were associated with superior anagram performance. A subsequent task demonstrated that self-regulatory resources were optimized for participants with both high affect- and value-related interest.

This strategy leads people to find evaluative answers of personal inadequacy or negativity of the world. The research aims at (a) test the hypotheses that why RI is significantly correlated to negative mood, even when controlling for depressive symptoms; (b) test whether non-clinical participants really tend to prefer the “how” RI, when coping with an unexpected negative event of everyday life; this results would suggest that the “how” style is more functional than the “why” style; (c) exploring beliefs that may guide the choice between the “how” or the “why” modes; (d) investigate the influence of a previous choice on the subsequent thinking style. 212 participants have been recruited.

The standard model was developed using detection and discrimination data collected from experiments that used deterministic patterns such as Gabor patches and gratings used as stimuli. However, detection data from experiments using noise as a stimulus suggests that the visual system may use adjustable-bandwidth, rather than fixed-bandwidth, channels. In our previous work, we used classification images as a key piece of evidence against the hypothesis that pattern detection is based on the responses of channels with an adjustable spatial frequency bandwidth. Here we tested the hypothesis that channels with adjustable orientation bandwidths are used to detect two-dimensional, filtered noise targets that varied in orientation bandwidth and were presented in white noise. Consistent with our previous work that examined spatial frequency bandwidth, we found that detection thresholds were consistent with the hypothesis that observers sum information across a broad range of orientations nearly optimally: absolute efficiency for stimulus detection was 20-30% and approximately constant across a wide range of orientation bandwidths. Unlike what we found with spatial frequency bandwidth, the results of our classification image experiment were consistent with the hypothesis that the orientation bandwidth of internal filters were adjustable. Thus, for orientation summation, both detection thresholds and classification images support the adjustable channels hypothesis. Classification images also revealed hallmarks of inhibition or suppression from uninformative spatial frequencies and/or orientations. This work highlights the limitations of the standard model of summation for orientation. The standard model of orientation summation and tuning was chiefly developed with narrow-band stimuli that were not presented in noise, stimuli that are arguably less naturalistic than the variable bandwidth stimuli presented in noise used in our experiments. Finally, the disagreement between the results from our experiments on spatial frequency summation with the data presented in this paper suggests that orientation may be encoded more flexibly than spatial frequency channels.","2014-06-12","2018-12-21 18:04:44","2018-12-21 18:04:44","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","channels; classification images; ideal observer; orientation; pattern vision; psychophysics; summation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a series of studies, we tested the hypothesis that knowing that a defendant had confessed would taint people's evaluations of handwriting evidence relative to those not so informed. In Study 1, participants who read a case summary in which the defendant had previously confessed were more likely to erroneously conclude that handwriting samples from the defendant and perpetrator were authored by the same person, and were more likely to judge the defendant guilty, compared with those in a no-confession control group. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings using a within-subjects design in which participants rated the same samples both before and after reading a case summary. These findings underscore recent critiques of the forensic sciences as subject to bias, and suggest the value of insulating forensic examiners from contextual information.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:04:45","2018-12-21 18:04:45","","256-270","","3","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","confessions; confirmation bias; context effects; forensic science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In creating a cognitive overload, emotions should have a negative effect on attentional resources necessary for spelling processes. Therefore, handling a dictation following a text previously read should lead to an increase in the proportion of spelling errors. In order to test this hypothesis, the initial experiment was duplicated with some modifications in the procedure. The emotional texts have been read twice and children's emotional feeling was measured three times. Results revealed an effect of the emotion on the feelings and on spelling performance as well. Moreover, the dictation exercise led to an increase in the negative emotional feeling.

This paper aims to test the hypothesis that common mental disorders have become more prevalent over the past two decades. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of prevalence, remission, duration, and excess mortality studies for anxiety disorders and MDD and then used a Bayesian meta-regression approach to estimate point prevalence for 1990, 2005, and 2010. We also conducted a post-hoc search for studies that used the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) as a measure of psychological distress and tested for trends to present a qualitative comparison of study findings Results: This study found no evidence for an increased prevalence of anxiety disorders or MDD. While the crude number of cases increased by 36%, this was explained by population growth and changing age structures. Point prevalence of anxiety disorders was estimated at 3.8% (3.6-4.1%) in 1990 and 4.0% (3.7-4.2%) in 2010. The prevalence of MDD was unchanged at 4.4% in 1990 (4.2-4.7%) and 2010 (4.1-4.7%). However, 8 of the 11 GHQ studies found a significant increase in psychological distress over time. Conclusions: The perceived “epidemic” of common mental disorders is most likely explained by the increasing numbers of affected patients driven by increasing population sizes. Additional factors that may explain this perception include the higher rates of psychological distress as measured using symptom checklists, greater public awareness, and the use of terms such as anxiety and depression in a context where they do not represent clinical disorders.

In Study 1, participants were assigned to 1 of 2 groups using a classic minimal group paradigm. Next, a reverse correlation image classification procedure was used to create visual renderings of ingroup and outgroup face representations. Subsequently, a 2nd sample naive to the face generation stage rated these faces on a series of trait dimensions. The results indicated that the ingroup face was significantly more likely than the outgroup face to elicit favorable impressions (e. g., trusting, caring, intelligent, attractive). Extending this finding, Study 2 revealed that ingroup face representations elicited more favorable implicitly measured attitudes than did outgroup representations, and Study 3 showed that ingroup faces were trusted more than outgroup faces during an economic game. Finally, Study 4 demonstrated that facial physiognomy associated with trustworthiness more closely resembled the facial structure of the average ingroup than outgroup face representation. Together, these studies suggest that minimal group distinctions can elicit different mental representations, and that this visual bias is sufficient to elicit ingroup favoritism in impressions, attitudes and behaviors.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:04:48","2018-12-21 18:04:48","","897-911","","6","106","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","face processing; ingroup favoritism; mental representation; minimal group paradigm; reverse correlation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although oftentimes considered as a unitary aspect of executive function, various lines of work support the notion that interference resolution may be better understood as multiple constructs, including resistance to proactive interference (PI) and response-distractor inhibition (e. g., Friedman & Miyake, 2004). Using this dichotomy, the present study assessed whether older adults (relative to younger adults) show impaired performance across both, 1, or neither of these interference resolution constructs. To do so, we used multiple tasks to tap each construct and examined age effects at both the single task and latent variable levels. Older adults consistently demonstrated exaggerated interference effects across resistance to PI tasks. Although the results for the response-distractor inhibition tasks were less consistent at the individual task level analyses, age effects were evident on multiple tasks, as well as at the latent variable level. However, results of the latent variable modeling suggested declines in interference resolution are best explained by variance that is common to the 2 interference resolution constructs measured herein. Furthermore, the effect of age on interference resolution was found to be both distinct from declines in working memory, and independent of processing speed. These findings suggest multiple cognitive domains are independently sensitive to age, but that declines in the interference resolution constructs measured herein may originate from a common cause.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:04:49","2018-12-21 18:04:49","","187-204","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; executive function; inhibition; interference resolution; proactive interference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tested the hypothesized pathways of the social development model (SDM) in young adulthood for predicting symptoms of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and positive functioning at age 30. A longitudinal panel study originally drawn from Seattle, Washington, elementary schools was examined. The sample included 808 participants with high retention and was gender balanced and ethnically diverse. Analyses focused on ages 21, 27, and 30. SDM constructs were assessed with self-reports of past-year behavior and combined multiple life domains. AUD symptoms corresponding to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Positive functioning combined measures of constructive engagement in work and school, civic engagement, physical exercise, and lack of depressive symptoms. The study found that AUD symptoms were moderately stable from age 21 to 30; however, developmental pathways hypothesized by the SDM at age 27 played a significant role in partially mediating this association. Alcohol-specific factors were key mediating mechanisms, whereas prosocial factors played little role. Conversely, prosocial factors had an important role in predicting positive functioning at age 30, whereas there were no significant pathways involving alcohol-specific factors. Findings suggest that age 27 is not too late for interventions targeting adult social development to help diminish alcohol use disorder symptoms by age 30. Alcohol-specific factors such as reducing perceived opportunities or rewards for heavy alcohol use or challenging beliefs accepting of drunkenness are likely to be key ingredients of effective adult interventions.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:04:52","2018-12-21 18:04:52","","348-358","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alcohol use disorder; positive functioning; social development; young adulthood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One hundred and three adult, daily, treatment-seeking smokers recorded their momentary affect, motivation to quit, abstinence confidence, and smoking behaviors in near real time with multiple EMA reports per day using electronic diaries postquit. Multilevel models indicated that initial levels of negative affect were associated with smoking, even after controlling for earlier smoking status, and that short-term increases in negative affect predicted lapses up to 12, but not 24, hr later. Positive affect had significant effects on subsequent abstinence confidence, but not motivation to quit. High levels of motivation appeared to reduce increases in lapse risk that occur over hours although momentary changes in confidence did not predict lapse risk over 12 hr. Negative affect had short-lived effects on lapse risk, whereas higher levels of motivation protected against the risk of lapsing that accumulates over hours. An increase in positive affect was associated with greater confidence to quit, but such changes in confidence did not reduce short-term lapse risk, contrary to expectations. Relations observed among affect, cognitions, and lapse seem to depend critically on the timing of assessments.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:04:53","2018-12-21 18:04:53","","376-388","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affect; confidence; ecological momentary assessment; motivation; smoking cessation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identification and acculturation strategies among minority members moderate the dehumanisation of the majority outgroup","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY","","0046-2772","10.1002/ejsp.2025","","The study of humanness as a dimension of social judgment has received extensive attention over the past decade. Although the common reported finding is that people attribute more human characteristics to their ingroup than to the outgroup, similar tendencies are expected to be tempered for minority groups when judging the host society. In Study 1, carried out with Gypsy minority members, we tested the hypothesis that those group members who adopt an assimilative strategy identifying more with the host compared with the heritage culture will display the lowest levels of dehumanisation. In Studies 2 and 3, conducted with immigrants in Italy and in Portugal, respectively, the hypothesis was extended from an identification conceptualisation to an acculturation one. Despite significant variability in intergroup settings and measures, results confirmed our hypothesis that immigrants who choose to assimilate with the host culture dehumanise the outgroup less compared with those who adopt any of the other acculturation strategies. Implications for the ethnocentric nature of dehumanisation biases and for intergroup relations in general are discussed.

Neurologists and neuroscientists now understand that several symptoms of the disease, including hallucinations and impulse control behaviors, stem from the dopaminergic medications used to control the motor aspects of PD. Converging evidence from animals and humans suggests that individual differences in the genes that affect the dopamine system influence the response of PD patients to dopaminergic medication. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that patients taking dopamine replacement therapy who carry candidate alleles that increase dopamine signaling, exhibit greater amounts of motor impulsivity. We examined the relation between inhibitory ability (measured by the Stop Signal Task) and polymorphisms of COMT Val158Met and DRD2 C957T in patients with idiopathic PD. On the Stop Signal Task, carriers of COMT Val/Met and Met/Met genotypes were more impulsive than Val/Val carriers, but we did not find a link between DRD2 polymorphisms and inhibitory ability. These results support the hypothesis that the Met allele of COMT confers an increased risk for behavioral impulsivity in PD patients, whereas DRD2 polymorphisms appear to be less important in determining whether PD patients exhibit a dopamine overdose in the form of motor impulsivity.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:04:55","2018-12-21 18:04:55","","278-286","","3, SI","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","COMT; dopamine; impulse control disorder; Parkinson disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such data have been viewed as evidence that objects are recognized via access to action features. Many objects, however, are associated with multiple actions. For example, a kitchen timer may be clenched with a power grip to move it but pinched with a precision grip to use it. The present study tested the hypothesis that action evocation during conceptual object processing is responsive to the visual scene in which objects are presented. Twenty-five healthy adults were asked to categorize object pictures presented in different naturalistic visual contexts that evoke either move- or use-related actions. Categorization judgments (natural vs. artifact) were performed by executing a move- or use-related action (clench vs. pinch) on a response device, and response times were assessed as a function of contextual congruence. Although the actions performed were irrelevant to the categorization judgment, responses were significantly faster when actions were compatible with the visual context. This compatibility effect was largely driven by faster pinch responses when objects were presented in use-compatible, as compared with move-compatible, contexts. The present study is the first to highlight the influence of visual scene on stimulus-response compatibility effects during semantic object processing. These data support the hypothesis that action evocation during conceptual object processing is biased toward context-relevant actions.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:04:56","2018-12-21 18:04:56","","645-651","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Concepts and categories; Embodied cognition; Stimulus-response compatibility; Visual selective attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: Caregivers (N = 91) of a parent with dementia completed questionnaires that assessed caregiving stressors (parental cognitive impairment and behavioral problems), attachment (early and present-day attachment) and measures of caregiver distress and satisfaction. A series of regression analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that better attachment quality may buffer the effects of cognitive impairment and behavioral problems on the caregiver's experience of distress and enhance caregiver satisfaction. Results: Results did suggest that present-day attachment moderates the effects of both cognitive impairment and behavioral problems on global distress but, contrary to our hypotheses, attachment security did not buffer the negative impact associated with these demands. Instead, secure present-day attachment was positively associated with an increased risk for emotional distress at mild levels of care-recipient cognitive impairment. Most analyses indicated no significant relationship between caregiving stressors and caregiver distress or satisfaction and few interactions based on attachment quality were found. Conclusions: Our study indicates that attachment security does not always have a protective or stress-buffering function but may amplify the effect of stressors under certain conditions. Different ways of understanding the obtained pattern of findings are discussed and additional work is required to test if secure attachment may be associated with increased resilience when the disease is more advanced.

To better understand older people's decisions to engage in post-retirement employment, the current study investigated the role of the psychological experience of aging. Two dimensions that capture positive aging experience (i.e., personal growth and gaining self-knowledge) and two dimensions that capture negative aging experience (i.e., physical loss and social loss) were differentiated and their relations to post-retirement employment were hypothesized. We argue that aging experience may influence the decision to work after retirement by generating both, approach and avoidance responses. Longitudinal data from the German Aging Survey (N = 551) were used to test the hypotheses. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that retirees who experienced aging as social loss and as personal growth were more likely to engage in post-retirement employment a decade later, while retirees who experienced aging as gaining self-knowledge were less likely to engage in post-retirement employment. Theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to test whether IA patients presented different psychological symptoms, temperamental traits, coping strategies and relational patterns compared with PG patients. The hypothesis was that IA patients will show greater interpersonal disengagement than PG patients. Methods: Two clinical groups (31 IA patients and 11 PG patients) and a control group (38 healthy subjects) matched with the clinical groups for gender and age were enrolled. The clinical groups were gathered in a psychiatric service for IA and PG in a hospital.

It also remains unclear if the well-established associations between ADHD symptoms and academic and social impairment are exacerbated by co-occurring internalizing symptoms. The purposes of the present study were to (1) examine whether ADHD symptoms would be associated with academic and social problems while also controlling for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms, and (2) test the hypothesis that anxious and depressive symptoms would moderate the relations between ADHD symptoms and academic and social problems. Participants were 142 at-risk Hispanic adolescents (54 % male, ages 14-19) who reported on their anxious and depressive symptoms, as well as their teachers who reported on adolescents' ADHD symptoms, ODD symptoms, academic problems, and social problems. When the psychopathology variables were included simultaneously in a path model, ADHD was the only domain significantly positively associated with academic problems. In contrast, ODD and depressive symptoms were the only domains significantly positively associated with social problems when all of the psychopathology variables were included in the path model. No moderation effects were found in relation to academic problems, although a significant ADHD x depression interaction was found in relation to social problems. Specifically, ADHD symptoms were not associated with social problems among adolescents who reported low levels of depressive symptoms, but the association between ADHD symptoms and social problems was significant at higher levels of depression. In addition to targeting oppositionality, attending to the combined presence of ADHD and depressive symptoms will be important for reducing the social impairments among Hispanic adolescents.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:05:00","2018-12-21 18:05:00","","265-275","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Academic functioning; ADHD; Adolescence; Anxiety; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Comorbidity; Depression; Hispanic youth; Social functioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the degree to which these dimensions of parenting uniquely influence child school readiness remains unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that parent demoralization and support for learning are distinct constructs that independently influence child school readiness. Direct and indirect (mediated) models of association were examined. 117 kindergarten children with low literacy and language skills and their parents were recruited from three Northeastern school districts serving primarily low-income families. Parents reported on their own depressive symptoms, parenting difficulties, attitudes and behaviors related to learning activities, and the frequency of parent-child conversation at home. Teachers rated child school readiness, as indicated by classroom behaviors, approaches to learning, and emergent language and literacy skills. In a factor analysis, parent demoralization and support for learning emerged as distinct constructs. Structural equation models revealed that parent demoralization was negatively associated with child school readiness, whereas parent support for learning was positively associated with child school readiness. Neither parenting construct mediated the effect of the other. Among low-income families with children at high risk for school difficulties, parental demoralization and support of learning opportunities at home appear to independently influence child school readiness. Thus, parent-based interventions targeting child school readiness would likely benefit from enhancing both parental self-efficacy and provision of learning activities.","2014-06","2018-12-21 18:05:01","2018-12-21 18:05:01","","353-371","","3","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Intervention; Learning; Literacy; Low-income; Parenting; School readiness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that psychological detachment would both mediate and moderate the relationship between workload and fatigue and that fatigue would mediate the relationship between psychological detachment and procrastination. We tested the hypothesized model by surveying 547 working adults at 3 points in time over a 2-month period. Psychological detachment fully mediated the relationship between workload and fatigue; psychological detachment did not moderate this relationship. Fatigue partially mediated the relationship between psychological detachment and procrastination. Further, workload was indirectly related to procrastination 2 months later through relationships with psychological detachment and fatigue.

Method: In this cross-sectional study, participants included 49 (29 male) children diagnosed with an NDC and 60 (30 male) typically developing (TD) children. Children in the NDC group had a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP; n = 41) or spina bifida (SB; n = 8). Parental nurturance was measured using the nurturance subscale of the Parenting Dimensions Inventory (PDI; Power, 1991). Data were analyzed using a 2 x 2 (gender x diagnosis) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with child age as the covariate. Results: As a simple main effect, parents reported more nurturing behavior toward TD girls than TD boys. However, girls with an NDC received less nurturance, thereby eliminating the gender difference in parental nurturance in the NDC sample. This pattern was reflected in the larger ANCOVA as a 2-way interaction between diagnosis and gender. Group differences in other PDI subscales were not statistically significant. Conclusions and Significance: This pattern of results suggests that the parents of girls with NDCs may be less nurturing toward them, thereby attenuating gender differences observed in families with TD children. Findings highlight the need for more research on the gendered dynamics in families with a child with an NDC to develop systemic models of family functioning and targeted parenting interventions for this group.","2014-05","2018-12-21 18:05:05","2018-12-21 18:05:05","","155-161","","2","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cerebral palsy; gender; neurodevelopmental conditions; parenting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuronal networks contributing to action selection, self-regulation and interoception could contribute to pathologic eating and body perception in people with anorexia nervosa. We tested the hypothesis that the salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN) would show decreased intrinsic activity in women with anorexia nervosa and those who had recovered from the disease compared to controls. The basal ganglia (BGN) and sensorimotor networks (SMN) were also investigated. Methods: Between January 2008 and January 2012, women with restricting-type anorexia nervosa, women who recovered from the disease and healthy control women completed functional magnetic resonance imaging during a conditioned stimulus task. Network activity was studied using independent component analysis. Results: We studied 20 women with anorexia nervosa, 24 recovered women and 24 controls. Salience network activity in the anterior cingulate cortex was reduced in women with anorexia nervosa (p = 0.030; all results false-discovery rate-corrected) and recovered women (p = 0.039) compared to controls. Default mode network activity in the precuneus was reduced in women with anorexia compared to controls (p = 0.023). Sensorimotor network activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA; p = 0.008), and the left (p = 0.028) and right (p = 0.002) postcentral gyrus was reduced in women with anorexia compared to controls; SMN activity in the SMA (p = 0.019) and the right postcentral gyrus (p = 0.008) was reduced in women with anorexia compared to recovered women. There were no group differences in the BGN. Limitations: Differences between patient and control populations (e. g., depression, anxiety, medication) are potential confounds, but were included as co-variates. Conclusion: Reduced SN activity in women with anorexia nervosa and recovered women could be a trait-related biomarker or illness remnant, altering the drive to approach food. The alterations in the DMN and SMN observed only in women with anorexia nervosa suggest state-dependent abnormalities that could be related to altered interoception and body image in these women when they are underweight but that remit following recovery.","2014-05","2018-12-21 18:05:06","2018-12-21 18:05:06","","178-188","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings show that participants performed better on frequency format questions only when one mental step was required to solve the task and when the data were in a compatible frequency format. By contrast, participants performed more poorly on more complicated tasks which required more mental steps (in a compatible frequency or probability format) or when the data and question formats were incompatible (Studies 1 and 2). Incompatibility between data and question formats was also associated with higher reaction times (Study 2b). Furthermore, on problems that incorporated incompatibility between the data sample size and the target (question) sample size, participants performed better on the probability question than the frequency question, regardless of data format (Study 3).

In a first study, individuals who perceived their attitudes toward gay men to be intended showed stronger implicit-explicit correspondence. In a second study, we manipulated perceptions of intent. Inferences that implicit bias was intended caused participants to express those biases on an explicit measure. A third study replicated the experimental effects and found that metacognitions of intent were especially influential among individuals who were motivated to be unprejudiced.

Linear regression analyses were conducted and adjusted for pack years, BMI, education and social factors, diet, exercise, marital status, and age. At birth black individuals had LTLs that were longer, on average, than their White counterparts (b = 3.85, p < 0.01).

Aims To test the hypothesis that comedians would resemble other creative individuals in showing a higher level of psychotic characteristics related to both schizophrenia and manic depression. Method A group of comedians (n=500+) and a control sample of actors (n=350+) completed an online questionnaire containing the short version of the Oxford Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE), with scales measuring four dimensions of psychotic traits. Scores were compared with general population norms. Results Comedians scored significantly above O-LIFE norms on all four scales. Actors also differed from the norms but on only three of the scales. Most striking was the comedians' high score on both introverted anhedonia and extraverted impulsiveness.. Conclusions This unusual personality structure may help to explain the facility for comedic performance.","2014-05","2018-12-21 18:05:10","2018-12-21 18:05:10","","341-345","","5","204","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES To test the hypothesis that the strength of coupling among 3 large-scale brain networks-salience, executive control, and default mode-will reflect the state of nicotine withdrawal (vs smoking satiety) and will predict abstinence-induced craving and cognitive deficits and to develop a resource allocation index (RAI) that reflects the combined strength of interactions among the 3 large-scale networks. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A within-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging study in an academic medical center compared resting-state functional connectivity coherence strength after 24 hours of abstinence and after smoking satiety. We examined the relationship of abstinence-induced changes in the RAI with alterations in subjective, behavioral, and neural functions. We included 37 healthy smoking volunteers, aged 19 to 61 years, for analyses. INTERVENTIONS Twenty-four hours of abstinence vs smoking satiety. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Inter-network connectivity strength (primary) and the relationship with subjective, behavioral, and neural measures of nicotine withdrawal during abstinence vs smoking satiety states (secondary). RESULTS The RAI was significantly lower in the abstinent compared with the smoking satiety states (left RAI, P =.002; right RAI, P =.04), suggesting weaker inhibition between the default mode and salience networks. Weaker inter-network connectivity (reduced RAI) predicted abstinence-induced cravings to smoke (r = -0.59; P =.007) and less suppression of default mode activity during performance of a subsequent working memory task (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, r = -0.66, P =.003; posterior cingulate cortex, r = -0.65, P =.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Alterations in coupling of the salience and default mode networks and the inability to disengage from the default mode network may be critical in cognitive/affective alterations that underlie nicotine dependence.","2014-05","2018-12-21 18:05:11","2018-12-21 18:05:11","","523-530","","5","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tested the utility of self-determination theory (SDT), a theory of motivation, to explain adherence to asthma medication regimens in African American adolescents. Method: We used baseline data from 168 urban African American adolescents (M-age = 13.94 years; 61% male) with poorly controlled asthma who were part of a trial testing the efficacy of interventions to improve adherence. Participants and their caregivers were interviewed using the Family Asthma Management System Scale; this study used the Asthma Medication Adherence subscale. Adolescents completed four asthma-specific scales representing the SDT constructs of autonomous motivation (one importance scale), competence (one confidence scale), and relatedness (two scales-family routines and parental support). Using multiple linear regression, we tested the hypothesis that SDT variables would predict adherence. Results: Adherence was significantly correlated with three SDT variables-importance, confidence, and family routines. In multivariate analysis, family routines was the only significant predictor of asthma adherence (p < .001). Asthma management behaviors integrated into and shared among family members was associated with better adherence. Greater confidence was marginally associated with increased adherence (p > .07). Conclusion: Though several variables representing SDT constructs were correlated with adherence, results demonstrate that family routines may be more relevant for African American adolescents' adherence than other SDT constructs. Thus, helping families to share and better integrate asthma care into daily schedules may be an important intervention strategy to improve medication adherence among high-risk African American adolescents.","2014-05","2018-12-21 18:05:11","2018-12-21 18:05:11","","461-464","","5","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescents; African American; asthma; self-determination theory; urban","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among patients reporting insomnia symptoms, sleep misperception occurs when self-reported sleep duration under-estimates objective measures. Misperception represents a clinical challenge since insomnia management is based entirely on patient self-report. We tested the hypothesis that misperception occurring in sleep apnea patients would improve with subsequent treatment. Methods: We compared subjective sleep-wake reports with objective sleep in adults with obstructive sleep apnea (n = 405) in two nights of polysomnography (diagnostic and treatment) within a median interval of 92 days. Results: Sleep latency was generally over-estimated, while wake after sleep onset and number of awakenings were under-estimated. None of these estimations differed between diagnostic and treatment polysomnograms. We observed a large spectrum of total sleep time misperception values during the diagnostic polysomnogram, with one third of the cohort under-estimating their total sleep time by at least 60 min. Of those with >60 minute misperception, we observed improved total sleep time perception during treatment polysomnography. Improved perception correlated with improvements in self-reported sleep quality and response confidence. We found no polysomnogram or demographic predictors of total sleep time misperception for the diagnostic polysomnogram, nor did we find objective correlates of improved perception during titration. Conclusion: Our results suggest that misperception may improve with treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients who also exhibit misperception. Within subject changes in misperception are consistent with misperception being, at least to some extent, a state characteristic, which has implications for management of patients with comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea.

We tested the hypothesis that these risks may be partly attributable to school mobility and examined the potential pathways linking school mobility to psychotic-like symptoms. Method: A community sample of 6,448 mothers and their children born between 1991 and 1992 were assessed for psychosocial adversities (i.e., ethnicity, urbanicity, family adversity) from birth to 2 years, school and residential mobility up to 9 years, and peer difficulties (i.e., bullying involvement and friendship difficulties) at 10 years. Psychotic-like symptoms were assessed at age 12 years using the Psychosis-like Symptoms Interview (PLIKSi). Results: In regression analyses, school mobility was significantly associated with definite psychotic-like symptoms (odds ratio [OR] =1.60; 95% CI =1.07-2.38) after controlling for all confounders. Within path analyses, school mobility (probit coefficient [beta] = 0.108; p = .039), involvement in bullying (beta = 0.241; p < .001), urbanicity (beta = 0.342; p = .016), and family adversity (beta = 0.034; p < .001) were all independently associated with definite psychotic-like symptoms. School mobility was indirectly associated with definite psychotic-like symptoms via involvement in bullying (beta = 0.018; p = .034). Conclusions: School mobility is associated with increased risk of psychotic-like symptoms, both directly and indirectly. The findings highlight the potential benefit of strategies to help mobile students to establish themselves within new school environments to reduce peer difficulties and to diminish the risk of psychotic-like symptoms. Awareness of mobile students as a possible high-risk population, and routine inquiry regarding school changes and bullying experiences, may be advisable in mental health care settings.","2014-05","2018-12-21 18:05:13","2018-12-21 18:05:13","","518-527","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ALSPAC; bullying; psychotic symptoms; school mobility; social defeat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background: Previous research has shown that action video game players outperform nonplayers on many single task measures of perception and attention. It is unclear, however, whether action video game players outperform nonplayers in complex, divided attention tasks. Method: Experienced action video game players and nongamers completed a street crossing task in a high-fidelity simulator. Participants walked on a manual treadmill to cross the street. During some crossings, a cognitively demanding working memory task was added. Results: Dividing attention resulted in more collisions and increased decision making time. Of importance, these dual task costs were equivalent for the action video game players and the nongamers. Conclusion These results suggest that action video game players are equally susceptible to the costs of dividing attention in a complex task.

Background: Because passive sonar does not provide unique course, speed, and range information on a contact, the submarine operates under significant uncertainty. There are many algorithms designed to address this problem, but all are subject to uncertainty. The extent of this solution uncertainty can be expressed in several ways, including a table of locations (course, speed, range) or a graphical area of uncertainty. Method: To test the hypothesis that the representation of uncertainty that more closely matches the experts' preferred representation of the problem would better support performance, even for the nonexpert., performance data were collected using displays that were either stripped of the spatial or the tabular representation. Results: Performance was more accurate when uncertainty was displayed spatially. This effect was only significant for the nonexperts for whom the spatial displays supported almost expert-like performance. This effect appears to be due to reduced mental effort. Conclusion: These results suggest that when the representation of uncertainty for this spatial task better matches the expert's preferred representation of the problem even a nonexpert can show expert-like performance. Application: These results could apply to any domain where performance requires working with highly uncertain information.","2014-05","2018-12-21 18:05:15","2018-12-21 18:05:15","","509-520","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive processes; decision making; knowledge representation; naturalistic decision making; problem solving; reasoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to combine surface anatomical and functional imaging modalities to quantify the integrity of cortical connectivity in pursuit of the neural basis of the Kraepelinian “line of divide.” We tested the hypothesis that multimodal brain regions show overlapping abnormalities in both disorders, while schizophrenia-specific defects are likely to be localized to sensory processing regions. Cortical folding patterns (gyrification) and functional connectivity hub architecture (degree centrality) were studied in a sample of 39 subjects with established schizophrenia, 20 subjects with psychotic bipolar disorder, and 34 healthy controls. We observed a significant difference between the 2 groups in both gyrification and functional connectivity of the visual processing regions. Further, the aberrant functional connectivity of the visual processing regions predicted persistent symptom burden better than the diagnostic information. Using a spatial similarity analysis, we observed that the degree of overlap between the 2 disorders was small (25%) for changes in cortical gyrification and modest (51%) for changes in functional connectivity measured during a cognitive task (n-back). In conclusion, our results suggest that prominent unimodal sensory processing deficits are more likely to be present in schizophrenia than in bipolar disorder. Further, connectivity-based neuroimaging measures appear to be better indicators of diagnostic discontinuity than the symptom-based clinical information.","2014-05","2018-12-21 18:05:17","2018-12-21 18:05:17","","675-684","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; gyrification; insula; Kraepelinian; schizophrenia; visual processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A series of nested structural equation models tested the hypothesized links among these peer-domain factors. It was hypothesized that (1) relational aggression trails both adaptive and maladaptive processes, linking to more peer victimization and more peer liking, whereas physical aggression is maladaptive, resulting in more peer victimization and less peer liking; (2) physical and relational victimization is maladaptive, relating to more aggression and less peer liking; (3) peer liking may be the social context that promotes relational aggression (not physical aggression), whereas peer liking may protect against peer victimization, regardless of its type; and (4) peer liking mediates the link between forms of aggression and forms of peer victimization. Results showed that higher levels of peer liking predicted relative increases in relational aggression (not physical aggression), which in turn led to more peer liking. On the other hand, more peer liking was predictive of relative decreases in relational aggression and relational victimization in transition to the next grade (i.e., fifth grade). In addition, relational victimization predicted relative increases in relational aggression and relative decreases in peer liking. Similarly, physical aggression was consistently and concurrently associated more physical victimization and was marginally predictive of relative increases in physical victimization in transition to the next grade. More peer liking predicted relative decreases in physical victimization, which resulted in lower levels of peer liking.

However, the specific contribution of each sensory system during attentional processing and, importantly, how these interact with the required behavioral motor goals remains unclear. Here we used electroencephalography and event-related potentials (ERPs) to test the hypothesis that activity from modality-specific somatosensory cortical regions would be enhanced with task-relevant bimodal (visual-tactile) stimuli and that the degree of modulation would depend on the difficulty of the associated sensory-motor task demands. Tactile stimuli were discrete vibrations to the index finger and visual stimuli were horizontal bars on a computer screen, both with random amplitudes. Streams of unimodal (tactile) and crossmodal (visual and tactile) stimuli were randomly presented and participants were instructed to attend to one type of stimulus (unimodal or crossmodal) and responses involved either an indication of the presence of an attended stimulus (detect), or the integration and summation of two stimulus amplitudes using a pressure-sensitive ball (grade). Force-amplitude associations were learned in a training session, and no feedback was provided during the task. ERPs were time-locked to tactile stimuli and extracted for early modality-specific components (P50, P100, N140). The P50 was enhanced with bimodal (visual-tactile) stimuli that were attended to. This was maximal when the motor requirements involved integration of the two stimuli in the grade task and when the visual stimulus occurred before (100 ms) the tactile stimulus. These results suggest that visual information relevant for movement modulates somatosensory processing as early as the primary somatosensory cortex (51) and that the motor behavioral context influences this likely through interaction of top-down attentional and motor preparatory systems with more bottom-up crossmodal influences.","2014-04-24","2018-12-21 18:05:21","2018-12-21 18:05:21","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attention; crossmodal; event-related potentials (ERPs); sensori-motor integration; somatosensory cortex; tactile; visual","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only in the contour-detection task could we find differential brain activity between contour and non-contour conditions, within a distributed brain network including parietal, lateral occipital and primary visual areas. Contour processing was associated with an inflow of information from lateral occipital into primary visual regions, as revealed from the slope of phase differences between source level oscillations within these areas.

MS increased the attention to positive (versus negative) images among participants higher in trait self-control, whereas those lower in trait self-control exhibited a non-significant trend in the opposite direction.

Results: Met alleles of BDNF moderated the relationship between recent life events and adult onsets of depression in a significant gene-environment interaction (interaction risk difference 0.216, 95% CI 0.090-0.342; P =.0008). BDNF did not significantly influence the effect of childhood maltreatment on chronic depression in the present sample. Conclusions: The Met allele of BDNF increases the risk of a new depressive episode following a severe life event. The BDNF and the serotonin transporter gene length polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and BDNF may contribute to depression through distinct mechanisms involving interactions with childhood and adulthood adversity respectively, which may, in combination, be responsible for a substantial proportion of depression burden in the general population.","2014-04","2018-12-21 18:05:26","2018-12-21 18:05:26","","326-334","","4","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","brain-derived neurotrophic factor; childhood maltreatment; etiology of major depressive disorder; gene-environment interaction; life events","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is why results have tended to be nonspecific and divergent across studies. Against this background, the authors undertook a review of the literature regarding the neuropsychology of sex offenders, taking into account subgroups based on criminological theories. They also conducted a meta-analysis of the data to demonstrate the cognitive heterogeneity of sex offenders statistically. Their main objective was to test the hypothesis to the effect that the neuropsychological deficits of sex offenders are not broad and generalized compared with specific subgroups of participants based on specific measures. In all, 23 neuropsychological studies reporting data on 1,756 participants were taken into consideration. As expected, a highly significant, broad, and heterogeneous overall effect size was found. Taking subgroups of participants and specific cognitive measures into account significantly improved homogeneity. Sex offenders against children tended to obtain lower scores than did sex offenders against adults on higher order executive functions, whereas sex offenders against adults tended to obtain results similar to those of non-sex offenders, with lower scores in verbal fluency and inhibition. However, it is concluded that neuropsychological data on sex offenders are still too scarce to confirm these trends or to test more precise hypotheses. For greater clinical relevance, future neuropsychological studies should consider specific subgroups of participants and measures to verify the presence of different cognitive profiles.","2014-04","2018-12-21 18:05:27","2018-12-21 18:05:27","","149-177","","2","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognition; neuropsychology; pedophiles; sex offenders; sexual deviance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research takes a dual-process perspective, suggesting that response coherence might be conditional upon response system (i.e., automatic versus reflective). In particular, we tested the hypothesis that response coherence should be maximal within each system and minimal across the two systems. To test this prediction, 36 participants underwent an anger provocation while two relatively automatic (anger accessibility and physiology) and two relatively reflective (anger experience and instrumental behavior) responses were measured. As predicted, coherence was found within the automatic and reflective systems, but not across them. Implications for emotion response coherence, dual-process frameworks, and the functions of emotions are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, we explored mindset effects on decision makers' confidence ratings, risk preferences, and susceptibility to anchoring effects. As earlier research on mindsets showed that individual differences sometimes moderate mindset effects, we also tested for interaction effects of mindset and gender. For confidence ratings, we found a main effect of mindset and a main effect of gender. For risk preferences and anchoring effects, mindset interacted with gender. When being in an implemental mindset, the judgments of female decision makers came closer to their actual performance compared to being in a deliberative mindset where they were observed as underconfident. Male decision makers were already overconfident in the deliberative mindset and showed even more overconfidence when being in an implemental mindset. Concerning risk attitudes it was found that female decision makers were more prone to choose the less risky, but also less profitable option (in terms of expected payoffs) when they were in the deliberative compared to the implemental mindset. For men the opposite effects were observed. When investigating anchoring effects, male but not female participants' judgments were influenced by mindset: In an implemental mindset, male participants followed an irrelevant anchor more strongly (i.e., made more anchor-consistent judgments) compared to being in a deliberative mindset.

The present study tested the hypothesis that these impairments may be related, such that people with schizophrenia would be differentially distracted by stimuli that strongly activate the magnocellular pathway. To accomplish this, we used a visual attention paradigm from the basic cognitive neuroscience literature designed to assess the capture of attention by salient but irrelevant stimuli. Participants searched for a target shape in an array of non-target shapes. On some trials, a salient distractor was presented that either selectively activated the parvocellular system (parvo-biased distractors) or activated both the magnocellular and parvocellular systems (magno+parvo distractors). For both manual reaction times and eye movement measures, the magno+parvo distractors captured attention more strongly than the parvo-biased distractors in people with schizophrenia, but the opposite pattern was observed in matched healthy control participants. These results indicate that attentional control deficits in schizophrenia may arise, at least in part, by means of an interaction with magnocellular sensory dysfunction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The current study used electro-encephalography (EEG) to test the hypothesis that giving participants different types and amounts of experience with specific objects would lead to differential patterns of sensorimotor rhythms during the observation of similar actions on those objects. While EEG was recorded, three groups of participants (n=20 in each group; mean age=22.0 years, SD=2.7) watched video clips of an actor reaching, grasping, and lifting two objects. Participants then received information about differences in weight between the two objects. One group gained this information through extended sensorimotor experience with the objects, a second group received much briefer sensorimotor experience with the objects, and the third group read written information about the objects' weights. Participants then viewed the action sequences again. For participants who had sensorimotor experience with the objects, the EEG response to viewing the actions was differentially sensitive to the anticipated weight of the objects. We conclude that this sensitivity was based on the participant's prior sensorimotor experience with the objects. The participants who only received semantic information about the objects showed no such effects. The primary conclusion is that even brief experience with actions affects sensorimotor cortex activity during the subsequent observation of similar actions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, damage to this region does not produce severe deficits in episodic memory performance as indexed by typical accuracy measures. Rather, because problems with memory confidence are frequently reported, the observed deficits may be best described as “metamemory” or subjective memory deficits. Here, we further investigated the inferior parietal lobe's role in recognition memory as well as metamemory. We tested the hypothesis that the inferior parietal lobe gauges the perceived oldness of items, given several neuroimaging findings suggesting that a portion of the left inferior parietal lobe is sensitive to perceived oldness. We tested two patients with bilateral parietal lobe lesions and Matched controls on an old/new recognition task. From these data we constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves by fitting the data with the unequal-variance signal-detection (UVSD) model. The results revealed no memory impairment in terms of patients' accuracy. However, patients exhibited lower hit rates and false alarms rates at high confidence levels. Further, patients and controls differed in how they set decision criteria for making recognition responses. Patients' decision criteria for “old” responses were shifted in a conservative fashion such that they were unwilling to endorse recognized target items with high levels of confidence. These findings provide constraints on models of inferior parietal lobe contributions to episodic memory retrieval. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Across 5 studies using experimental, survey, and archival data and multiple measures of free will belief, we tested the hypothesis that a key factor promoting belief in free will is a fundamental desire to hold others morally responsible for their wrongful behaviors. In Study 1, participants reported greater belief in free will after considering an immoral action than a morally neutral one. Study 2 provided evidence that this effect was due to heightened punitive motivations. In a field experiment (Study 3), an ostensibly real classroom cheating incident led to increased free will beliefs, again due to heightened punitive motivations. In Study 4, reading about others' immoral behaviors reduced the perceived merit of anti-free-will research, thus demonstrating the effect with an indirect measure of free will belief. Finally, Study 5 examined this relationship outside the laboratory and found that the real-world prevalence of immoral behavior (as measured by crime and homicide rates) predicted free will belief on a country level. Taken together, these results provide a potential explanation for the strength and prevalence of belief in free will: It is functional for holding others morally responsible and facilitates justifiably punishing harmful members of society.","2014-04","2018-12-21 18:05:37","2018-12-21 18:05:37","","501-513","","4","106","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","free will; moral reasoning; moral responsibility; motivation; punishment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Humility is characterized by a willingness to accept the self and life without comforting illusions, and by low levels of self-focus. As a consequence, it was expected to render mortality thoughts less threatening and less likely to evoke potentially destructive behavior patterns. In line with this reasoning, Study 1 found that people high in humility do not engage in self-serving moral disengagement following mortality reminders, whereas people low in humility do. Study 2 showed that only people low in humility respond to death reminders with increased fear of death, and established that this effect was driven uniquely by humility and not by some other related personality trait. In Study 3, a low sense of psychological entitlement decreased cultural worldview defense in response to death thoughts, whereas a high sense of entitlement tended to increase it. Study 4 demonstrated that priming humility reduces self-reported death anxiety relative to both a baseline and a pride priming condition. Finally, in Study 5, experimentally induced feelings of humility prevented mortality reminders from leading to depleted self-control. As a whole, these findings obtained from relatively diverse Internet samples illustrate that the dark side of death anxiety is brought about by a noisy ego only and not by a quiet ego, revealing self-transcendence as a sturdier, healthier anxiety buffer than self-enhancement.","2014-04","2018-12-21 18:05:38","2018-12-21 18:05:38","","610-623","","4","106","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","entitlement; humility; self-transcendence; terror management theory; virtue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we introduce a new child-appropriate experimental paradigm to measure goal neglect in children between 7 and 11 years of age and test the hypothesis that the complexity of an action plan, not real-time trial demands, increases goal neglect. A total of 66 children (M-age = 9.50 years) were administered a Feature Match task. Half of the children were given four rules for matching, and half were given three rules for matching. After practice, the four-rules group was told to ignore the additional rule, and both groups completed an identical three-rules task. The results showed that the extra rule increased goal neglect and its correlation with fluid intelligence. Although intermittent trial errors were correlated with fluid intelligence for both groups, only in the four-rules group were systematic rule failures (i.e., goal neglect) correlated with fluid intelligence. Task performance improved with chronological age; however, when controlling for the influence of fluid intelligence, the relationship between age and task performance was effectively removed. This suggests that a child's current level of fluid intelligence (and not age) determines task performance. We suggest that the relationship among goal neglect, complex task instructions, and fluid intelligence is linked to the mental preparation for future events, that is, mentally compiling verbal instructions into a set of activated goal representations in working memory that represent what is to be done and under what circumstances.

There was also an indication of selective language use corresponding to the age-based categorization.

We present a novel binocular version of the moving window technique to study the roles of the two eyes in reading, and we describe a basic experiment allowed by this technique. In the binocular moving window paradigm, each eye contributes its own window to a composite binocular window onto the text. We studied the reading of single lines of text in three conditions: no windows, a symmetrical 8-letters-left and 8-letters-right window for each eye, and a leftward-skewed 14-letters-left and 2-letters-right window for each eye. Note that both eyes saw the composite window onto the text. We tested the hypothesis that readers could be encouraged to generate a greater binocular disparity to augment their window onto the text and to provide a greater preview for one eye. The data offered limited support for this prediction. We observed considerable individual differences in both baseline fixation disparity and in readers' response to the critical asymmetric [14,2] window.","2014-03-16","2018-12-21 18:05:43","2018-12-21 18:05:43","","259-282","","3-4, SI","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Binocularity; Fixation disparity; Individual differences; Moving windows; Parafoveal preview; Reading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although neurological soft signs have been consistently described in patients with schizophrenia, their diagnostic specificity is not well clarified. Methods. To test the hypothesis that neurological soft signs are specifically related to schizophrenia, we examined 305 subjects (patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, n = 167; patients with bipolar I disorder, n = 88; controls, n = 50). Neurological soft signs were assessed using the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to compute the diagnostic predictive power of neurological soft signs. Results. Patients in the schizophrenia-spectrum disorder group were found to have significantly greater neurological impairment (NES total score = 23.9, standard deviation [SD] 11.2) than those in the bipolar disorder group (NES total score = 18.2, SD 7.6; p < 0.001). Neurological functioning was closely associated with psychopathology (all p < 0.001). The NES total score reliably distinguished patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders from those with bipolar disorder in 68.7% of the cases (p < 0.001). Moreover, a particular set of neurological soft signs showed specificity for the schizophrenia-spectrum disorder diagnostic group. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be distinguished in terms of neurological impairment. Furthermore, we recommend the utility of neurological soft signs as a useful, quantifiable, sensitive, and inexpensive tool for the diagnostic work-up of schizophrenia.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:10","2018-12-21 18:10:10","","147-153","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; Neurological Evaluation Scale; neurological impairment; neurological soft signs; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little research has tested process explanations for such effects. The current study tested the hypothesis that low sensitivity is associated with automatic approach biases for alcohol cues, coupled with deficits inhibiting responses in the presence of such cues. Eighty-five participants varying in alcohol sensitivity completed an Alcohol-Approach Avoidance Task and a Cued Go/No-Go Task while event-related potentials were recorded. Low sensitivity (LS) individuals showed evidence of automatic approach tendencies toward alcohol cues in both tasks, and experienced deficits inhibiting prepotent responses cued by alcohol images. Additionally, the event-related potential data indicated that LS individuals experienced more conflict when attempting to inhibit alcohol-cued responses, but not nonalcohol-cued responses, compared with their high-sensitivity counterparts. Together, these data indicate that alcohol cues elicit an approach bias among LS individuals, translating into greater difficulty inhibiting behavioral responses in the presence of such cues, a pattern generally supportive of dual process models of substance use.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:11","2018-12-21 18:10:11","","85-96","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","addiction; alcohol; dual process models; event-related potentials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In two recently published studies we confirmed the hypothesis that the perception of increased pain during both treatment-refractory depression (predominantly unipolar) and difficult-to-treat bipolar depression was related to increased state rejection sensitivity (i.e., rejection sensitivity when depressed). In the present study, we aimed to compare the correlates of pain and rejection sensitivity in individuals with bipolar versus unipolar depression and test the hypothesis that bipolar disorder may be distinguished from unipolar depression both by an increased perception of pain and heightened rejection sensitivity during depression. Methods We analyzed data from 113 bipolar and 146 unipolar depressed patients presenting to the Black Dog Institute, Sydney, Australia. The patients all met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder or unipolar depression (major depressive disorder). Results Bipolar disorder predicted a major increase in state rejection sensitivity when depressed (p=0.001), whereas trait rejection sensitivity (i.e., a long-standing pattern of rejection sensitivity) was not predicted by polarity. A major increase in the experience of headaches (p=0.007), chest pain (p<0.001), and body aches and pains (p=0.02) during depression was predicted by a major increase in state rejection sensitivity for both bipolar and unipolar depression. Conclusions State, but not trait, rejection sensitivity is significantly predicted by bipolar depression, suggesting that this might be considered as a state marker for bipolar depression and taken into account in the clinical differentiation of bipolar and unipolar depression.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:11","2018-12-21 18:10:11","","190-198","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; depression; diagnostic; pain; rejection sensitivity; unipolar disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we test the hypothesis that the effect may be even more independent from g than previously thought This is due to the fact that secular gains in IQ result from at least two sources. First, an authentic Flynn effect that results from environmental improvements and should therefore be strongly negatively related to the g loading (and therefore the heritability) of IQ subtests. Second, a “Brand effect”, which results from an increase in the number of correct answers simply via enhanced guessing. As harder items should encourage more guessing, secular gains in IQ stemming from this Brand effect should be positively associated with subtest g loadings. Analysis of Estonian National Intelligence Test data collected between 1933 and 2006, which includes data on guessing, g loadings and secular IQgains, corroborates this hypothesis. The correlation between gains via the Brand effect and g loadings is.95, as predicted. There is a modest negative association between raw secular gain magnitude and subtest g loadings (- .18) that increases to - .47 when these are controlled for the Brand effect Applying five psychometric meta-analytic corrections to this estimate raises it to - .82 indicating that the authentic Flynn effect is substantially more independent from g than previously thought (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Chloroquine can cause cell death, including neurons. We aimed to identify the most frequent type of psychiatric manifestation and symptomatological characteristics of psychosis following chloroquine ingestion (PFC). Method: Out of a total of 4471 randomly selected recent-onset psychosis patients, 3610 consecutive patients who had responded to standard treatment were screened for entry in the study. We compared background clinicodemographic profile information and psychopathology of 51 PFC patients, who were either drug free or drug naive, to 51 brief psychotic disorder (BPD) patients who were matched in terms of age, sex and education. Only those patients who remitted within 8 weeks (PFC patients) or 4 weeks (BPD patients) were included. Cranial computed tomography, electroencephalography and lumbar puncture of the entire experimental group were normal, and none had Mini Mental Status Examination score <22. Group difference and correlational statistics (parametric and nonparametric) have been used to test the hypotheses and explain the results. Results: The most common (76.2%) type of psychiatric disturbance in PCF group was mood disorder (mixed episode) accompanied by predominant irritability with little blunting of affect. PFC patients characteristically had prominent positive symptoms with visual hallucination and derealization experiences. They were more restless, agitated and anxious and had more disturbed thought content and orientation, but better preserved insight. There was no linear relationship between the amount of chloroquine consumed and the severity of psychosis. Conclusion: Considering the large number of patients still receiving chloroquine especially in developing countries, this study has been presented to draw attention of the psychiatrists and other health professionals to the hazardous effect of chloroquine on mental health.

Based on the notion that artists are typically perceived as eccentric, creative and skilled, we tested the hypothesis that eccentricity increases perceptions of artistic quality. In Study 1, Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting was evaluated more positively when he was said to have cut off his left ear lobe than when this information was not presented. In Study 2, participants liked art more when the artist was eccentric. In Study 3, the evaluation of fictitious art increased because of the artist's eccentric appearance. Study 4 established that the eccentricity effect was specific to unconventional as opposed to conventional art. In Study 5, Lady Gaga's music was more appreciated when she was displayed as highly eccentric; however, the eccentricity effect emerged only when the display seemed authentic. These novel findings indicate that art evaluations are partly rooted in perceptions of artists' eccentricity and evidence the importance of perceived authenticity and skills for these attributions.

However, much of the existing research has focused on the impact of receiving support; the effects of giving support have largely been neglected. Using the biopsychosocial perspective, this study aimed to examine the independent impact of giving support to others on older adults' perceived health status. Methods Data for this study were obtained from a nationwide community-based cross-sectional survey entitled `Determinants of Wellness among Older Malaysians: A Health Promotion Perspective', which was conducted in 2010. To assess the unique effects of giving support on perceived health status, above and beyond other possible known factors, a four-step hierarchical regression model using SPSS was used to test the hypothesis. Results The findings from the analysis revealed that giving support to others was a significant positive predictor of older adults' perceived health status after receiving support, demographic variables and chronic medical conditions were considered. Further results showed that giving support to others had almost twice the effect on perceived health status (beta = 0.11, P < 0.001) as receiving support (beta = 0.06, P < 0.05). Conclusion The findings from this study underscore the need to develop programmes that encourage older adults' participation in productive activities such as caring for and helping others and volunteering.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:13","2018-12-21 18:10:13","","31-37","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aged; giving social support; hierarchical regression; perceived health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M. Foynes, J. J. Freyd, & A. P. Deprince, 2009, Child abuse, betrayal and disclosure, Child Abuse & Neglect, 33, 209-217). Nondisclosure of abuse may serve a protective function in that it allows for the maintenance of a necessary, albeit abusive, relationship. This dynamic may be particularly relevant for people who adhere strongly to Asian cultural values of interdependence and may be differentially applicable to disclosure of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. An online study was conducted with Asian Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs; N = 266) to test the hypothesis that Asian values, rather than ethnic group membership, would be associated with decreased disclosure of VC abuse, but not affect disclosure of NVC abuse. The impact of Asian values was expected to be the strongest for disclosure of VC sexual abuse. A series of backward stepwise logistic regressions revealed that Asian values, but not ethnicity, were significantly associated with nondisclosure of VC sexual and emotional abuse, but not VC physical abuse. Neither ethnicity nor Asian values was associated with disclosure of any type of NVC abuse. Female gender increased the odds of VC abuse disclosure only. By examining the impact of cultural values on disclosure of particular abuse types and uncovering the limitations of attending to ethnicity alone, we hope to inform efforts toward facilitating recovery from trauma and creating more supportive environments for survivors.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:13","2018-12-21 18:10:13","","134-141","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Asian values; disclosure; emotional abuse; physical abuse; sexual abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Burnout is a chronic affective state comprised of symptoms of emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness. It is an outcome of depletion of energetic resources resulting from prolonged exposure to work and life stresses. Building upon the Conservation of Resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989), this prospective study was designed to test the hypothesis that CMI interacts with burnout to facilitate the development of depressive symptoms. Method: Participants were 4,861 employed men and women, aged 19 to 67 years, who came for routine health examinations and were followed for 18 months on average. Forty-seven percent reported having one or more diagnosed CMIs. Results: Burnout was found to predict an increase in depressive symptoms in apparently healthy individuals. Furthermore, the coexistence of burnout in employees with a CMI accelerates the process of developing depressive symptoms within a relatively short period. Burnout was also found to be associated with intensification of preexisting depressive symptoms in employees suffering from different chronic medical conditions (other than cancer), independent of medical comorbidities and other potent confounding variables. Conclusions: Among employees, coexistence of burnout and at least one CMI predicts an increase in depressive symptoms with time. Health care professionals should be made aware of such at-risk employees and follow and manage them closely.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:13","2018-12-21 18:10:13","","264-272","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","burnout; chronic illness; depression; employed adults","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that adolescent girls interpret ambiguous scenarios more negatively, and/or less positively, than same-aged males using the Adolescent Interpretation and Belief Questionnaire (N=67, 11-15years old). We also tested whether adolescent girls and boys differed in judging positive or negative interpretations to be more believable and whether the scenario content (social vs. non-social) affected any sex difference in interpretation bias. The results showed that girls had higher average negative interpretation scores than boys, with no sex differences in positive interpretation scores. Girls and boys did not differ on which interpretation they found to be most believable. Both sexes reported that positive interpretations were less likely to come to mind, and were less believable, for social than for non-social scenarios.

In Studies 1-3, undergraduates reported their grade-point averages (GPAs) following either an achievement goal prime or a control prime. Academic exaggeration (higher self-reported than official GPA) was the indicator of self-reactivity to the prime. Study 1 involved a direct achievement goal prime, whereas Studies 2 and 3 involved indirect priming techniques. In all 3 experiments, greater academic exaggeration following the achievement goal prime (but not the control prime) predicted better academic performance a semester later (based on official records). Study 4 demonstrated that the magnitude of students' GPA goals mediated the association between academic exaggeration and subsequent performance (1 year later). The fact that self-reactivity to a single achievement goal prime in the lab predicted later performance in “real life” suggests that individual differences in reactivity to a specific prime can signal much broader motivational orientations related to the primed goal.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:14","2018-12-21 18:10:14","","458-468","","3","106","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","achievement; goals; implicit cognition; self","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to test the hypothesis that systematic alterations of within-person test-score distributions characterize worsening cognitive impairment. Method: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 2 datasets that included 395 clinical patients and 135 neurologically normal older adults (>= 60 years old). We computed each person's mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis for a battery of 13 neuropsychological measures and compared these distributional properties across groups. Results: Most healthy older adults produced normal (Gaussian) test-score distributions. Among patients, test-score distributions increasingly shifted away from normal with worsening cognitive impairment. Worsening dementia was accompanied by progressively lower mean scores and increasingly positive skew. Within-person standard deviations initially grew at mild levels of impairment, but then shrank with worsening dementia, resulting in positive kurtosis. Conclusions: Within-person distributional properties vary as a function of dementia severity. Despite the limitations associated with using a clinical rather than a research sample, the analyses reported here serve as a “proof of concept” and suggest that similar investigations with more rigorously characterized patient samples may be fruitful.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:14","2018-12-21 18:10:14","","254-260","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","dementia; intraindividual variability; neuropsychological assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We test the hypothesis that higher level of harm avoidance is associated with increased likelihood of cerebral infarction. Method: Older persons without dementia completed a standard measure of harm avoidance. During a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up, 257 (of 1,082) individuals died of whom 206 (80%) underwent brain autopsy. The number of chronic cerebral infarcts (microscopic plus gross; expressed as 0, 1, or >1) was assessed on neuropathologic examination, completed in 192 individuals at the time of analyses. Results: On postmortem examination, chronic cerebral infarcts were found in 89 (42 with 1, 47 with >1). Higher harm avoidance was associated with higher likelihood of infarcts (odds ratio = 1.083, 95% confidence interval = 1.040-1.128). A moderately high level of the trait (score = 17, 75th percentile) was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the likelihood of infarction compared with a moderately low level of the trait (score = 6, 25th percentile).

Methods: A prototype Inventory of Seclusion and Restraint Reduction Interventions (ISRRI) tracked fidelity over time. Outcome measures seclusion and restraint events as percentages of total inpatient population and seclusion and restraint hours as percentages of total inpatient hours conformed to licensed Behavioral Health Performance Measurement System specifications. Independent variables were facility and patient characteristics. Facilities were classified into five implementation types based on ISRRI scores: stabilized (N=28), continued (N=7), decreased (N=5), discontinued (N=1), or never implemented (N=2). For the stabilized group, linear modeling and random-effects meta-analysis compared the contribution of individual facilities to an overall effect. Subgroup analyses explored relationships between facility characteristics and outcomes. Dose-effect analysis tested the hypothesis that the stabilized group would have more positive outcomes. Results: Overall, the stabilized group reduced the percentage secluded by 17% (p=.002), seclusion hours by 19% (p=.001), and proportion restrained by 30% (p=.03). The reduction in restraint hours was 55% but nonsignificant (p=.08). Individual facility effect sizes varied; some rates increased for some facilities. The dose-effect hypothesis was supported for two outcomes, seclusion hours and percentage restrained. The order of implementation group effects in relation to each outcome varied unpredictably. Conclusions: The 6CS was feasible to implement and effective in diverse facility types. Fidelity over time was nonlinear and varied among facilities. Further research on relationships between facility characteristics, fidelity patterns, and outcomes is needed.","2014-03","2018-12-21 18:10:14","2018-12-21 18:10:14","","345-351","","3","65","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary aim of this randomized controlled pilot trial was to test the hypothesis that abstinence at month 6 would be greater among patients with chronic pain who received the CB intervention compared to a control condition. Upon admission to a 3-week interdisciplinary pain treatment (IPT) program, patients were randomized to receive the CB intervention (n = 30) or the control condition (n = 30). The 7-day point prevalence of self-reported smoking status was assessed at week 3 (upon completion of the 3-week IPT program) and at month 6 in an intent-to-treat analysis. At week 3, 30% (n = 9) of patients in the CB condition were abstinent from smoking compared to 10% (n = 3) in the control group (P = .104). At month 6,20% (n = 6) of patients who received the CB intervention were abstinent compared to none in the control group (P = .024). At week 3, a significant group by time interaction effect was found where the CB patients experienced greater improvements in self-efficacy from baseline compared to the control group (P = .002). A greater proportion of patients randomized to the CB group completed the IPT program (P = .052). The findings of this pilot trial suggest that integration of a CB-based smoking abstinence intervention into ongoing pain therapy may be an effective treatment for smokers with chronic pain.

Across two studies we find that narcissistic exploitativeness is indeed associated with increased emotion recognition, but in some cases the confounding effects of mood need to be considered (Study 1). Importantly, effect sizes of narcissistic exploitativeness were similar in magnitude to two different measures of dispositional empathy, which is an established correlate of emotion recognition.

Using the Weather Prediction Task (WPT), 23 healthy controls and 10 adult first-degree Relatives Of Schizophrenia (ROS) patients were examined to determine the extent to which cognitive skill learning was automated using a dual-task paradigm to detect subtle impairments in skill learning. Automatization of a skill is the ability to execute a task without the demand for executive control and effortfiil behavior and is a skill in which schizophrenia patients possess a deficit. ROS patients did not differ from healthy controls in accuracy or reaction time on the WPT either during early or late training on the single-task trials. In contrast, the healthy control and ROS groups were differentially affected during the dual-task trials. Our results demonstrate that the ROS group did not automate the task as well as controls and continued to rely on controlled processing even after extensive practice. This suggests that adult ROS patients may engage in compensatory strategies to achieve normal levels of performance and support the hypothesis that impaired cognitive skill learning is associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia.

Abnormalities in the neuroimmune and the stress-signaling pathways have been previously identified in brains of individuals with both diseases. However, the possible relationship between abnormalities in stress and neuroimmune signaling within the cortex of people with psychotic illness has not been defined. To test the hypothesis that combined alterations in brain stress responsiveness and neuroimmune/inflammatory status are characteristic of some individuals suffering from major mental illness, we examined gene expression in the Stanley Array Cohort of 35 controls, 35 individuals with schizophrenia and 34 individuals with bipolar disorder. We used levels of 8 inflammatory-related transcripts, of which SERPINA3 was significantly elevated in individuals with schizophrenia (F (2,88) = 4.137, P < 0.05), and 12 glucocorticoid receptor signaling (stress) pathway transcripts previously examined, to identify two clusters of individuals: a high inflammation/stress group (n = 32) and a low (n = 68) inflammation/stress group. The high inflammation/stress group has a significantly greater number of individuals with schizophrenia (n = 15), and a trend toward having more bipolar disorder individuals (n = 11), when compared with controls (n = 6). Using these subgroups, we tested which microarray-assessed transcriptional changes may be associated with high inflammatory/stress groups using ingenuity analysis and found that an extended network of gene expression changes involving immune, growth factors, inhibitory signaling and cell death factors also distinguished these groups. Our work demonstrates that some of the heterogeneity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may be partially explained by inflammation/stress interactions, and that this biological subtype cuts across Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-defined categories.","2014-02","2018-12-21 18:10:16","2018-12-21 18:10:16","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; glucocorticoid receptor; heterogeneity; inflammation; personalized medicine; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attachment theory provides a framework for elucidating the ways in which maternal PTSD may increase offspring PTSD vulnerability. The current study utilized two independent prospective data sets to test the hypotheses that (a) maternal PTSD increases the probability of developing an insecure mother-infant attachment relationship and (b) an insecure mother-infant attachment relationship increases the risk of developing PTSD following trauma exposure in later life. In the first study of urban, primarily low-income ethnic/racial minority mothers and infants (N = 45 dyads), elevated maternal PTSD symptoms at 6 months were associated with increased risk for an insecure, particularly disorganized, mother-infant attachment relationship at 13 months. In the second birth cohort of urban, low-income mothers and children (N = 96 dyads), insecure (avoidant or resistant) attachment in infancy was associated in a dose-response manner with increased lifetime risk for a diagnosis of PTSD by adolescence. A history of disorganized attachment in infancy predicted severity of PTSD symptoms, including reexperiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and total symptoms, at 17.5 years. In both studies, associations between attachment and PTSD were not attributable to numerous co-occurring risk factors. The findings suggest that promoting positive mother-child relationships in early development, particularly in populations at high risk for trauma exposure, may reduce the incidence of PTSD.","2014-02","2018-12-21 18:10:17","2018-12-21 18:10:17","","41-65","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little research has examined the relationship between control over memory retrieval and individual differences in inhibitory control. Higher levels of resting heart rate variability (HRV) are associated with greater inhibitory control, as indicated by better performance on a number of cognitive, affective, and motor tasks. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that higher levels of resting HRV predict enhanced memory inhibition as indexed by performance on the think/no-think task. Efforts to suppress no-think word pairs resulted in impaired recall for those items, as in past studies. Moreover, higher levels of resting HRV were associated with more successful suppression, as indicated by lower recall of the to-be-avoided stimuli relative to baseline stimuli.

Using community participants oversampled for psychopathic traits (N = 104), we found that psychopathic traits, measured using self-and informant reports, manifested small correlations with some measures of physical pain tolerance (tolerance of pressure and electric shock) but not others (tolerance of cold temperature). In addition, pain tolerance, particularly tolerance of pressure, manifested small correlations with a history of antisocial and aggressive behavior. However, there was little evidence that pain tolerance serves as a mediator of the relations between psychopathy and violent or nonviolent ASB.

The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that both the body size and countermovement depth confound the relationship between the muscle power output and performance of maximum vertical jumps. Sixty young and physically active males were tested on the maximum countermovement (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ). The jumping performance (H-max), peak (P-peak) and the average power output (P-avg) during the concentric phase, countermovement depth (only in CMJ) and body mass as an index of body size were assessed. To assess the power-performance relationship, the correlations between H-max with both P-peak and P-avg were calculated without and with controlling for the effects of body mass, as well as for the countermovement depth. The results revealed moderate poliver-performance relationships (range .55<r<.64) that were comparable for CMJ and SJ jumps. When controlled for body mass, the same values were markedly higher (.61<r<.82; p<.05 for P-peak of both jumps). When controlled for both the body mass and countermovement depth, CMJ revealed r=.88 and r=.77 for P-peak and Pan, respectively. Both jumps revealed stronger relationships with P-peak than with P-avg (p<.05) when controlled for either body mass or both body mass and countermovement depth. We conclude that both body size (in CMJ and Si) and countermovement depth (in CMJ) confound the relationship between the muscle power output with the performance of maximum vertical jumps. Regarding routine assessments of muscle power from jumping performance and vice versa, the use of CMJ is recommended, while P-peak, rather than P-avg, should be the variable of choice.

Some of these neurotransmitters play an inhibitory role, while others play a facilitatory role modulating aggression. Preclinical studies suggest a facilitatory role for inflammatory markers in aggression. Despite this, to our knowledge, no studies of aggression and inflammatory markers have been reported in psychiatric patients or in individuals with recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that plasma inflammatory markers will correlate directly with aggression and will be elevated in individuals with recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study in a clinical research program in impulsive aggressive behavior at an academic medical center. Participants were physically healthy individuals with intermittent explosive disorder (n = 69), nonaggressive individuals with Axis I and/or II disorders (n = 61), and nonaggressive individuals without history of an Axis I or II disorder (n = 67). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Plasma levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 were examined in the context of measures of aggression and impulsivity and as a function of intermittent explosive disorder. RESULTS Both plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 levels were significantly higher in participants with intermittent explosive disorder compared with psychiatric or normal controls. In addition, both inflammatory markers were directly correlated with a composite measure of aggression and, more specifically, with measures reflecting history of actual aggressive behavior in all participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data suggest a direct relationship between plasma inflammatory processes and aggression in humans. This finding adds to the complex picture of the central neuromodulatory role of aggression in humans.","2014-02","2018-12-21 18:10:20","2018-12-21 18:10:20","","158-165","","2","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study sample consisted of 234 individuals, drawn from a clinical PD group (n = 112) and one demographically matched non-psychiatric group (n = 122) using a shared battery of measures, which included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Symptom Checklist-90-R and the Adult Attachment Interview, which was used to assess RF levels. The results indicated that childhood adversity predicted low level of RF, which in turn was associated with PD onset later in life. A combination of different early adverse experiences had a significantly greater impact on lowering RF scores than experiencing either neglect or abuse alone. Mediation analyses confirmed that RF was a significant mediator between adversity and PD diagnoses and between adversity and psychiatric distress.

Recent literature has suggested that workshops are largely ineffective unless followed up by consultation or supervision. However, not all therapists have this option, and the question remains whether there are ways to potentiate workshop learning in the absence of follow-up consultation. This study tested the hypothesis that creating opportunities to reflect in the weeks following a workshop would enhance learning and utilization of skills. Two groups of practitioners, who attended the same 2-day CBT skills workshop in successive years, were compared: a training-as-usual group and a reflection group. The reflection group completed reflection worksheets at the end of each workshop day and were instructed to complete follow-up reflection worksheets at 1,4 and 8 weeks post-workshop. Ten weeks after the workshop, the reflection group reported enhanced use of new skills with clients and a trend towards increased awareness of workshop learning. Further analysis revealed that group differences were almost entirely linked to use of follow-up reflection worksheets. Those participants in the reflection group who used follow-up reflection worksheets reported far greater awareness and use of skills than those who did not. Reminder emails had the predicted effect of increasing the use of the reflection worksheets; twice as many participants in the email reminder group used the reflection sheets compared with the nonreminder group. The results suggest that the relatively simple strategy of introducing reflection worksheets to workshop handouts, and sending reminder emails may significantly enhanced learning and utilization of workshop skills.","2014-02","2018-12-21 18:10:22","2018-12-21 18:10:22","","12-19","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","CBT training; dissemination; implementation; psychotherapy training; reflection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that two psychological mechanisms-agonistic striving and subordination-mediate the link between perceived neighborhood disorder and hypertension risk in youth. Perceived neighborhood disorder, agonistic striving, subordination experiences, negative affect, obesity, and ambulatory blood pressure during daily activities (48 h) were assessed in a multiethnic sample of 167 low- to middle-income urban adolescents. Path analyses revealed that agonistic striving, subordination, and obesity each independently mediated the association between neighborhood disorder and blood pressure; these variables accounted for 73 % of the shared variance, 42 % of which was explained by agonistic striving. The direct relationship between perceived neighborhood disorder and blood pressure was no longer significant in the presence of these mediators. Negative affect was associated with neighborhood disorder and subordination, but not blood pressure. Agonistic striving proved to be a significant and substantial mediator of the association between perceived neighborhood disorder, blood pressure, and future hypertension risk. New research should seek to clarify the processes by which stressful neighborhoods induce persistent agonistic motives and perceptions of subordination in adolescents.","2014-02","2018-12-21 18:10:22","2018-12-21 18:10:22","","113-126","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescent health; Agonistic striving; Hypertension risk; Implicit motives; Perceived neighborhood disorder; Social power; Subordination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In two studies, n Achievement was assessed through content-coding of imaginative stories and salivary C was assessed both at baseline and post-task. In Study 1 (N = 108 US students), n Achievement predicted an attenuated C response to a one-on-one competition in the laboratory, regardless of whether participants won or lost. In Study 2 (N = 62 German students), n Achievement predicted an attenuated C response to the Trier Social Stress Test (Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993), but not to a non-stressful control task. In Study 2 only, the attenuating effect of n Achievement was moderated by gender, with only men showing the effect. Across both studies, the average effect size of the association between n Achievement and C responses to difficult tasks was r = -.28.

We report the results of an eye-movement monitoring study investigating the relative timing of syntactically-mediated variable binding and discourse-based coreference assignment during pronoun resolution. We examined whether ambiguous pronouns are preferentially resolved via either the variable binding or coreference route, and in particular tested the hypothesis that variable binding should always be computed before coreference assignment. Participants' eye movements were monitored while they read sentences containing a pronoun and two potential antecedents, a c-commanding quantified noun phrase and a non c-commanding proper name. Gender congruence between the pronoun and either of the two potential antecedents was manipulated as an experimental diagnostic for dependency formation. In two experiments, we found that participants' reading times were reliably longer when the linearly closest antecedent mismatched in gender with the pronoun. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that variable binding is computed before coreference assignment, and instead suggest that antecedent recency plays an important role in affecting the extent to which a variable binding antecedent is considered. We discuss these results in relation to models of memory retrieval during sentence comprehension, and interpret the antecedent recency preference as an example of forgetting over time.

The aim of this study is to propose and test a comprehensive model of compliance with environmental law (EL). The legal and psychosocial peculiarities of environmental transgressions suggest that the nature and relative impact of the determinants of ordinary people's compliance with EL may differ from those involved in compliance with ordinary laws. Method. A total of 439 university students of Law, Psychology, Pedagogy, and Speech Therapy majors, aged between 18 and 58, took part in the study. Participants answered a questionnaire assessing illegal anti-ecological behaviour (IAEB), legal-sanction-related variables, injunctive and prescriptive social norms, personal norms, and sustainability attitudes. The data from all participants were processed using structural equation analysis to test the hypothesized model. Results. The main antecedents of IAEB are personal norms and, to a lesser extent, sustainability attitudes and descriptive social norms. Personal norms on IAEB are influenced by injunctive social norms and also by sustainability attitudes. Legal-sanction-related variables affect personal norms and IAEB, but only by indirectly influencing social norms. Conclusions. Although legal-sanction-related variables and norms have been traditionally used to explain illegal behaviour, the legal and psychosocial peculiarities of IAEB are reflected in the process of compliance with environmental protection laws. Results allow for a refinement of the relationship between personal and social norms, showing that the main determinants of IAEB is personal norm, but that descriptive social norms also directly affect behaviour, and that sustainability attitudes play an unquestionable role in compliance with ELs.","2014-02","2018-12-21 18:10:26","2018-12-21 18:10:26","","80-103","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose and experimentally test the hypothesis that general mechanisms of intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration, also called curiosity-driven learning, can self-organize developmental stages during early vocal learning. We introduce a computational model of intrinsically motivated vocal exploration, which allows the learner to autonomously structure its own vocal experiments, and thus its own learning schedule, through a drive to maximize competence progress. This model relies on a physical model of the vocal tract, the auditory system and the agent's motor control as well as vocalizations of social peers. We present computational experiments that show how such a mechanism can explain the adaptive transition from vocal self-exploration with little influence from the speech environment, to a later stage where vocal exploration becomes influenced by vocalizations of peers. Within the initial self-exploration phase, we show that a sequence of vocal production stages self-organizes, and shares properties with data from infant developmental psychology: the vocal learner first discovers how to control phonation, then focuses on vocal variations of unarticulated sounds, and finally automatically discovers and focuses on babbling with articulated proto-syllables. As the vocal learner becomes more proficient at producing complex sounds, imitating vocalizations of peers starts to provide high learning progress explaining an automatic shift from self-exploration to vocal imitation.","2014-01-16","2018-12-21 18:10:27","2018-12-21 18:10:27","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","curiosity-driven learning; goal babbling; imitation; interactive learning; intrinsic motivation; self-organization; vocal development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One group then learned sectional anatomy using two-dimensional sectional representations, with the expectation that there would be transfer of learning from whole to sectional anatomy. The second group learned sectional anatomy by moving a virtual cutting plane through the three-dimensional model. In tests of long-term retention of sectional neuroanatomy, the group with graphically integrated representation recognized more neural structures that were known to be challenging to learn.

We tested the hypothesis that cumulative exposure to up to 20 different types of trauma and bereavement/loss incrementally predicts high-risk adolescent behavior beyond demographic variables. Adolescents reporting exposure to at least 1 type of trauma (n = 3,785; mean age = 15.3 years; 62.7% girls) were selected from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Core Data Set (CDS). Logistic regression analyses tested associations among both demographic variables and number of types of trauma and loss exposure as predictors, and 9 types of high-risk adolescent behavior and functional impairment (attachment difficulties, skipping school, running away from home, substance abuse, suicidality, criminality, self-injury, alcohol use, and victim of sexual exploitation) as criterion variables. As hypothesized, hierarchical logistic regression analyses revealed that each additional type of trauma exposure significantly increased the odds ratios for each problem behavior (range = 1.06-1.22) after accounting for demographic variables. Some demographic variables (female gender, public insurance eligibility, and older age) were also associated with increased likelihood for some outcomes.

Memory and its distortion may be temporarily employed first to keep truthful information away from both self and others and later to retrieve accurate information to benefit the self. Using a dual-retrieval paradigm, we tested the hypothesis that people are likely to deceive themselves to better deceive high-rather than equal-status others. College student participants were explicitly instructed (Study 1 and 2) or induced (Study 3) to deceive either a high-status teacher or an equal-status fellow student. When interacting with the high-but not equal-status target, participants in three studies genuinely remembered fewer previously studied items than they did on a second memory test alone without the deceiving target. The results support the view that self-deception responds to status hierarchy that registers probabilities of deception detection such that people are more likely to self-deceive high-rather than equal-status others.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:34","2018-12-21 18:10:34","","635-654","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","deception; memory; self-deception; status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, prior studies often measure category knowledge through tasks that involve identifying only the typical features of a category. This neglects an important aspect of a category's internal structure: how typical and atypical features are distributed within a category. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that inference learning results in richer knowledge of internal category structure than classification learning. We introduced several new measures to probe learners' representations of within-category structure. Experiment 1 found that participants in the inference condition learned and used a wider range of feature dimensions than classification learners. Classification learners, however, were more sensitive to the presence of atypical features within categories. Experiment 2 provided converging evidence that classification learners were more likely to incorporate atypical features into their representations. Inference learners were less likely to encode atypical category features, even in a “partial inference” condition that focused learners' attention on the feature dimensions relevant to classification. Overall, these results are contrary to the hypothesis that inference learning produces superior knowledge of within-category structure. Although inference learning promoted representations that included a broad range of category-typical features, classification learning promoted greater sensitivity to the distribution of typical and atypical features within categories.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:36","2018-12-21 18:10:36","","1786-1807","","9","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Category learning; Classification; Feature inference; Representation; Typicality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - These hypotheses were tested in a panel design with hierarchical regression analyses over two years with 150 works councillors from Germany. Self-reported political skill, time involvement, and position were measured at time 1, and political skill was measured again two years later. Findings - Works council members increase their political skill when they hold a higher position and have more time involvement. Further, councillors' age was found to moderate these relationships. That is, older councillors develop political skill (specifically networking ability) at a higher rate than middle aged employees. Research limitations/implications - Future research should test the hypotheses in different populations and also include other ratings of political skill. Practical implications - It might not always be necessary to have available relevant social skills for a new job already, as these skills can develop over time. Social implications - Political skill is a resource at the workplace with the potential to promote fairness, health, and well-being. Originality/value - The present findings add a new perspective to interpersonal skill development: certain job demands moderated by age can change a job incumbent's social skills, particularly networking ability, over time and make her or him more capable of doing well. Thus, it is not always necessary to have available relevant social skills for a new job, as these relevant skills can developed within the context of the new job.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:38","2018-12-21 18:10:38","","582-599","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Influence; Learning on the job; Networking ability; Political skill; Self development; Social skill development; Workplace learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - In two independent samples (n = 270 and n = 214), currently employed participants completed self-report surveys. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to assess common method variance and provide evidence of construct validity. Findings - In Study 1, a general measure of Machiavellianism was positively related to perceived work entitlement, but PWE was not significantly related to the criterion. In Study 2, three sub-scales of Machiavellianism, as well as a different measure of the PWE, were positively related to perceived work entitlement. However, the fourth sub-scale of Machiavellianism was negatively related and therefore in the opposite direction of that which was hypothesized. Research limitations/implications - The primary limitations of the research are the cross-sectional research design and minor risk of common method bias. However, numerous a priori and post hoc procedures were incorporated in an attempt to minimize this risk. Practical implications - Managers need to understand how certain dispositional factors influence the degree to which employees perceive that they are entitled to rewards that at times are inconsistent with their contribution to the organization. Social implications - As the workforce ages and older employees are replaced, understanding the dispositional influences on perceived work entitlement helps explain why some, often times younger, workers feel more entitled to organizational rewards than do others. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first to examine relevant dispositional correlates of perceived work entitlement, which is a construct developed from equity theory.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:40","2018-12-21 18:10:40","","808-828","","7","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Entitlement; Machiavellianism; Narcissism; Protestant work ethic; Self-esteem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - The paper focussed on four common experiences and tested the hypotheses about their effects using data collected by a relatively large survey among mature college students with work experience (n = 1,164). Findings - Individuals who had been exposed to the experiences of being laid off, witnessing layoffs and having to accept reductions in pay or status held higher transactional and lower relational expectations from their future employers, in comparison with individuals who had not been exposed to such experiences. They also anticipated a higher level of job insecurity in their future employment. Practical implications - In order to mitigate the potential negative consequences of the phenomenon discovered on employee retention and organizational performance, organizations have to develop and implement specific HR practices to deal with cohorts of new members, who have been exposed to the employment experiences investigated. Of particular importance are orientation and socialization practices that address new recruits' concerns and expectations, and exposing new members to training and learning experiences that increase their employability outside the organization. Originality/value - This is one of a few studies that documents empirically the (anecdotally based) claims about the effects of changes in the economic environment on individuals' employment expectations and perhaps the first study to focus specifically on the effects of initial experiences of entrants to the labor market. It extends psychological contract research by focussing on the antecedants and formation of the psychological contract rather than on its consequences and on the anticipatory contract rather than on employees' current psychological contracts.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:41","2018-12-21 18:10:41","","553-572","","4","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anticipated job insecurity; Anticipatory psychological contracts; Changes in employment practices; Initial employment experiences; Quantitative; Relational and transactional expectations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawn upon the resource-based view and alignment theory, HRM competency is expected to be related to the adoption of high performance work systems (HPWS) and the achievement of external fit in HRM, which in turn contribute to firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - The data for this study were collected via a survey of in 157 Chinese enterprises located in the high technology development zone of three large cities. Two different respondents from each firm provided information about organizational characteristics, HRM policy and practices, and firm performance. Multiple regressions were used to test the hypotheses. Findings - Results indicate that HRM competency has a significant and positive effect on firm performance. Such an effect is found to be mediated by the achievement of external fit, but not the adoption of HPWS. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the study include cross-sectional data, perceptual measure of firm performance, omission of external variables, and restricted sample. This study highlights the importance of HRM competency in strategic HRM, and provides evidence about how this construct is linked to firm performance.

It further reveals that the achievement of external fit mediates the relationship between HRM competency and firm performance, and hence contributes to the HRM literature.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:42","2018-12-21 18:10:42","","898-914","","6","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Chinese enterprises; External fit in HRM; Firm performance; High performance work systems; HRM competency; Quantitative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the outshining hypothesis, Experiment 1 tested whether retrieval support enhances witness performance (compared to free recall) especially when witnessing conditions are suboptimal (e.g., because witnesses were distracted during the crime). Eighty-eight participants watched a videotaped crime with either full or divided attention and subsequently received retrieval support with the Self-Administered Interview (c) (SAI) or completed a free recall (FR). One week later (Time 2 - T2) all participants completed a second FR. Unexpectedly, retrieval support did not lead to better memory performance than FR under divided attention conditions, suggesting that retrieval support is not effective to overcome adverse effects of divided attention. Moreover, presence of retrieval support at Time 1 (T1) had no effect on memory performance at T2. Experiment 2 (N - 81) tested the hypothesis that these T2-results were due to a reporting issue undermining the memory-preserving effect of T1-retrieval support by manipulating retrieval support (SAI vs. FR) at T1 and T2. As expected, T1-retrieval support led to increased accuracy at T2. Thus, the beneficial value of T1-retrieval support seems greatest with high-quality T2-interviews. Interviewers should consider this when planning a subsequent interview.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:43","2018-12-21 18:10:43","","1005-1027","","10","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","divided attention; eyewitness testimony; outshining hypothesis; retrieval support; self-administered interview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that the psychological well-being of employees is differentially related to the hiring of temporary employees for reactive restructuring motives compared with anticipatory support motives, such that the psychological well-being of permanent employees is positively associated with the hiring of temporary employees for anticipatory support motives but negatively associated with the hiring of temporary employees for reactive restructuring motives. Externalization motives are only weakly associated with the psychological well-being of temporary employees. The moderating role of the type of contract on the relationship between externalization motives and psychological well-being reveals the importance of future research on the relation between externalization strategies and the psychological well-being of permanent and temporary employees in blended workforces.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:44","2018-12-21 18:10:44","","803-815","","6","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Blended workforce; Externalization motives; Job insecurity; Psychological well-being; Temporary employment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This difference cannot be attributed to differences in how listeners allocate attention across a sentence; a second study confirms that readers are equally sensitive to agreement violations in at-issue and not-at-issue contents. A third rating experiment shows that the results do not depend on the restrictive relative clause intervening on the subject-verb dependency. A final experiment shows that the observed effects obtain with definite determiners and demonstratives alike.

Although other adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin have been extensively investigated in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), no studies have evaluated omentin levels in major depression. Therefore, this study sought to test the hypothesis that drug-naive patients with MDD would have lower serum omentin levels than a healthy control group similar in age, sex, and body mass index. Subjects and methods: Thirty patients with MDD (10 men) and 30 healthy control subjects (10 men) were studied. Plasma concentration of omentin, along with other biochemical parameters, was measured after a period of fasting. The severity of depression was determined by the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: No significant difference was found between patients with MDD (723.3 +/- 233.8 ng/ml) and healthy comparison subjects (670.7 +/- 351.8 ng/ml) in mean plasma concentrations of omentin (p>0.05). There was no significant correlation between plasma omentin levels and depression severity (r=-0.147; p>0.05). Conclusions: This is the first investigation of omentin levels in patients with MDD.

Although fatal attempts are frequent in the elderly, research indicated that they rarely present long-term elaboration of suicidal ideation and communicate their intents. Consequently, risk factor detection and assessment are salient. Although evidence on the association between personality and suicidal ideation in young adults is accumulating, little is known about its relevance in the elderly. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the components of a measurement model that are invariant across young adults and older adults and then investigate the relations among dimensions of personality and suicide risk. We postulated a specific relation pattern a priori and tested the hypotheses statistically in order to examine the models for equivalency of the factorial measurement. Method: We investigated 316 young adults and 339 older adults, who were administered self-report questionnaires to assess depression, hopelessness, alternative five-factor model of personality, and self-other perception. Results: Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses were conducted, yielding a final model with excellent fit to the data. This model showed a similar pattern of associations between suicidal ideation and personality across both groups. Conclusions: Although the elderly are exposed to specific life stressors associated with suicidal ideation, our findings suggest that the elderly and young adults may be similar on personality and psychopathology variables predicting suicidal ideation than previously hypothesized. Implications are provided for enhanced assessment and intervention of the elderly high in neuroticism, depression, hopelessness, and with negative self-other perception.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:50","2018-12-21 18:10:50","","792-800","","6","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","elderly; extraversion; hopelessness; neuroticism; suicide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These results indicate that brief exposure to babyish (relative to mature) faces, even without an extensive interaction, can lead to the satisfaction of social belongingness needs.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:51","2018-12-21 18:10:51","","273-277","","4","154","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","face perception; facial morphology; social belonging; social perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the influence of directly incriminating information has been widely researched, the effect of crime story information has never been studied. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that incriminating information affects judgments directly, whereas crime story information affects judgments indirectly via the arousal of negative emotions. We did this by coding the two types of information in 78 press articles about a criminal trial heard in France. Participants (N = 312) were asked to read the articles and then indicate their anger arousal and give their judgment about the accused. The results support our hypothesis. We conclude by discussing the contribution of our findings to research into the media's influence on legal cases.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:52","2018-12-21 18:10:52","","659-672","","7","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","crime story; emotions; incriminating information; judgments; media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of sleep loss on both cognition and the sleep electroencephalogram remain mostly unknown. Acute sleep loss impacts brain gene expression broadly. These data contributed to current hypotheses regarding the role for sleep in metabolism, synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. These changes in gene expression likely underlie increased sleep intensity following sleep deprivation (SD). Here we tested the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms coordinate the gene expression response driven by SD. We found that SD altered the cortical genome-wide distribution of two major epigenetic marks: DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in gene pathways involved in neuritogenesis and synaptic plasticity, whereas large changes (>4000 sites) in hydroxymethylation where observed in genes linked to cytoskeleton, signaling and neurotransmission, which closely matches SD-dependent changes in the transcriptome. Moreover, this epigenetic remodeling applied to elements previously linked to sleep need (for example, Arc and Egr1) and synaptic partners of Neuroligin-1 (Nlgn1; for example, Dlg4, Nrxn1 and Nlgn3), which we recently identified as a regulator of sleep intensity following SD. We show here that Nlgn1 mutant mice display an enhanced slow-wave slope during non-rapid eye movement sleep following SD but this mutation does not affect SD-dependent changes in gene expression, suggesting that the Nlgn pathway acts downstream to mechanisms triggering gene expression changes in SD. These data reveal that acute SD reprograms the epigenetic landscape, providing a unique molecular route by which sleep can impact brain function and health.","2014-01","2018-12-21 18:10:53","2018-12-21 18:10:53","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cortical synchrony; DNA methylation and hydroxylation; sleep need; transcription","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a validated pain anticipation task and tested the hypotheses that individuals with a reported history of MTBI, compared with healthy comparison subjects, would show increased brain response to pain anticipation and ineffective pain modulation after controlling for psychiatric symptoms. Eighteen male subjects with a reported history of blast-related MTBI related to combat, and eighteen healthy male subjects with no reported history of MTBI (healthy controls) underwent fMRI during an event-related experimental pain paradigm with cued high or low intensity painful heat stimuli. No subjects in either group met diagnostic criteria for current mood or anxiety disorder. We found that relative to healthy comparison subjects, after controlling for traumatic and depressive symptoms, participants with a reported history of MTBI showed significantly stronger activations within midbrain periaqueductual grey (PAG), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cuneus during pain anticipation. Furthermore, we found that brain injury was a significant moderator of the relationship between anticipatory PAG activation and reported subjective pain. Our results suggest that a potentially disrupted neurocognitive anticipatory network may result from damage to the endogenous pain modulatory system and underlie difficulties with regulatory pain processing following MTBI. In other words, our findings are consistent with a notion that brain injury makes it more difficult to control acute pain. Understanding these mechanisms of dysfunctional acute pain processing following MTBI may help shed light on the underlying causes of increased vulnerability for the development of pain-related conditions in this population.","2014-01","2018-12-21 18:10:54","2018-12-21 18:10:54","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","concussion; dorsolateral prefrontal; emotion; imaging; PAG; post-traumatic stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the primary goal of this study was to examine the impact of the interaction of BPD symptoms and relationship satisfaction on state negative affect in college undergraduates. It was predicted that individuals who scored higher on measures of BPD symptoms and who were in a satisfying romantic relationship would report less negative affect than comparable individuals in a less satisfying romantic relationship. Questionnaires assessing BPD symptoms, relationship satisfaction, and negative affect were administered to 111 women, the majority of whom then completed daily measures of relationship satisfaction and negative affect over a 2-week follow-up period. Hierarchical multiple regression and hierarchical linear modeling were used to test the hypotheses. The interaction of BPD symptoms with relationship satisfaction was found to significantly predict anger, as measured at one time point, suggesting that satisfying romantic relationships may be a protective factor for individuals scoring high on measures of BPD symptoms with regard to anger.","2014-01","2018-12-21 18:10:55","2018-12-21 18:10:55","","20-25","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","borderline personality disorder; experience sampling methodology; hierarchical linear modeling; negative affect; relationship satisfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lesion and imaging studies have shown that the frontal lobes are important in mediating divergent thinking, and frontal lobe function is highly dependent on white matter connections with subcortical and cortical networks. Normal aging often results in deficits in functions controlled by the frontal lobes, as well as decrements in white-matter connectivity. Objectives of this study included comparing non-time-constrained tasks of verbal divergent processing in young adults (YAs) and older adults (OAs) and correlating performance with tasks of working memory, language ability, and disengagement/inhibition. Participants were 30 YAs and 30 OAs. Contrary to the a priori hypothesis, OAs produced significantly more unique responses than YAs, although total fluency was not significantly different. Correlational analyses examining the groups together and separately revealed a number of differences suggesting that the groups were utilizing different underlying cognitive abilities to complete these tasks.

We sought to determine whether stressful negative life events are associated with incidental dementia in a population-based study with long-term follow-up. We also tested the hypothesis that the occurrence of positive life events could mitigate or overcome the possible adverse effects of negative life events on dementia conversion. Methods: The study involved 2,462 dementia-free participants aged 55 years and older. Information on life events was ascertained at baseline from a comprehensive Life Event Inventory, which included 56 questions about specific life events. For each life event, the emotional impact (both positive and negative) and emotional adjustment were asked for. Results: During follow-up, 423 participants developed dementia; of these, 240 developed Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cox regression analysis showed no association between the total number of negative life events and the incidence of dementia when adjusted solely for age and gender (hazard ratio = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.92-1.02), or with multiple adjustments for a range of covariates (hazard ratio = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.91-1.01). Similarly, neither emotional impact nor emotional adjustment to these life events was associated with incident dementia. A separate analysis of AD did not alter the results. Conclusions: The result of this population-based study finds no association between negative or positive life events and dementia.

However, little research has examined social networks among people with comorbid PTSD/AD despite evidence suggesting these two conditions commonly co-occur and are linked to particularly severe problems. To test the hypothesis that people with comorbid PTSD/AD experience particularly elevated social network problems, individuals with lifetime diagnoses of PTSD, AD, comorbid PTSD/AD, or no lifetime history of Axis I psychopathology in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication were compared on four dimensions of social networks: (I) Closeness, (2) Conflict, (3) Family Support, and (4) Apprehension. Persons with PTSD, AD, or comorbid PTSD/AD endorsed more problems with the Conflict, Family Support, and Apprehension factors compared to people with no history of Axis I psychopathology. Moreover, individuals with comorbid PTSD/AD endorsed greater Apprehension and significantly less Family Support compared to the other three groups. Results suggest people with comorbid PTSD/AD experience increased problems with their family as well as greater concerns about enlisting social support than even people with PTSD or AD alone. Treatments for people suffering from comorbid PTSD/AD should consider assessing for and possibly targeting family support and apprehension about being close to others. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is unclear what the consequences of this war are, in particular with regard to levels of childhood maltreatment (CM) in offspring. Objective: Our study aims to analyze the influences of fathers' war exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the offspring's CM and simultaneously test the hypothesis of the intergenerational transmission of father-child CM. Method: Cross-sectional data were collected, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form, from 203 adult children and 117 fathers. Subjects were distributed according to three conditions based on the father's war exposure status: did not participate in war, or non-war-exposed (NW); participated in war, or war-exposed (W); and war-exposed with PTSD diagnosis (WP). The data were examined using correlations, variance/covariance, and regression analyses. Results: Children of war veterans with PTSD reported more emotional and physical neglect, while their fathers reported increased emotional and physical abuse exposure during their own childhood. Significant father-child CM correlations were found in the war veteran group but less in the war veteran with PTSD group. Father CM predicted 16% of offspring CM of children of war veterans. Conclusions: The father's war-related PTSD might be a risk factor for offspring neglect but potentially a protective one for the father-child abuse transmission. War-exposed fathers without PTSD did transmit their own CM experiences more often. Therefore, father's war exposure and father's war PTSD may each be important variables to take into account in the study of intergenerational transmission of CM.","2014","2018-12-21 18:10:59","2018-12-21 18:10:59","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Abuse; intergenerational transmission; neglect; offspring; Portugal; PTSD; war","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus far, studies on the role of avoidance in the development and maintenance of PTSD focused primarily on strategic or explicit avoidance. However, patients may also show implicit avoidance behavior, which may remain even when explicit avoidance is reduced. Objectives: The present pilot study was designed to test the hypothesis that PTSD patients show implicit avoidance of threatening, trauma-related stimuli. In addition, it was tested whether this avoidance behavior also occurs for other stimuli. Methods: The Approach-Avoidance Task was used as an indirect measure of avoidance. Participants were 16 women suffering from PTSD who had experienced a sexual trauma, and 23 healthy non-traumatized women. Using a joystick, they pulled pictures closer to themselves or pushed them away. The pictures varied in content, being either high-threat sexual, non-threat sexual, high-threat accident, or positive. Results: Compared to control participants, PTSD patients avoided high-threat sexual pictures, and the degree of avoidance was predicted by self-reported arousal level. Moreover, PTSD patients with high levels of self-reported explicit avoidance, depressive symptoms, and PTSD symptom severity also avoided high-threat accident pictures. Conclusions: These findings point to the possible importance of threat value instead of trauma-relatedness in explaining implicit avoidance. The results are discussed in light of cognitive-behavioral models of PTSD, and clinical implications are suggested.","2014","2018-12-21 18:11:00","2018-12-21 18:11:00","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT); avoidance; PTSD; trauma-relatedness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines perceived control as a mediator of trialability-product adoption relationship, and gender difference as a moderator of the relationship between trialability-product adoptions. A field survey was conducted to test the hypotheses of the study. Respondents were graduate students from Taiwan universities. A total of 411 undergraduate students with massively multiplayer online gaming (MMOGs) experience participated in this study. The structural equation model (SEM) method was employed to analyze the data. The findings indicate that perceived product trialability has a direct influence on intent to play new games, and indirect effects through perceived process control. Gender differences also moderate the trialability effects on the adoption of new online games. Perceived trialability had more of an effect on intention to play new online games for female players than for male players. To develop an effective product development and communication strategy, the finding suggests that online game firms should focus on new product characteristics and consider consumer gender differences.

Participants orally described the mediator produced immediately after studying each item, if any. After a delay, they were given cued recall, made FOK ratings, and attempted to recall their original mediator. Concreteness and item repetition enhanced strategy recall, which had a large effect on FOKs. Controlling on strategy recall reduced the predictive validity of FOKs for recognition memory, indicating that access to the original aspects of encoding influenced FOK accuracy. Confidence judgments (CJs) for correctly recognized items covaried with FOKs, but FOKs did not fully track the strategy recall associations with CJs, suggesting emergent effects of strategy cues that were elicited by recognition tests but not accessed at the time of the FOK judgment.

Logistic regression analysis showed that among cases CPP was the only individual NBS associated with a history of multiple surgeries, and then only modestly [odds ratio (OR) 1.9, confidence intervals (CI) 1.06, 32]. By far the strongest association was the number of NBSs. The OR for multiple surgeries increased with number of NBSs: for cases with 4-5 NBSs the OR was 14.1 (1.8, 113) and with 6-9 NBSs, 33.1 (3.9, 279). Controls had fewer syndromes and fewer surgeries and this linkage was less prominent. Conclusion: Among IC/BPS cases, the number of NBSs was strongly correlated with the number of surgeries. Understanding temporal relationships will be necessary to explore causal linkages and may modify surgical practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

CSD usually follows acute attacks of vertigo or dizziness and is thought to arise from patients' failure to re-establish normal locomotor control strategies after resolution of acute vestibular symptoms. Pre-existing anxiety or anxiety diathesis may be risk factors for CSD. This study tested the hypothesis that patients with CSD are more likely than individuals with other chronic neurotologic illnesses to possess anxious, introverted personality traits. Methods: Data were abstracted retrospectively from medical records of 40 patients who underwent multidisciplinary neurotology evaluations for chronic dizziness. Twenty-four subjects had CSD. Sixteen had chronic medical conditions other than CSD plus co-existing anxiety disorders. Group differences in demographics, Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores, DSM-IV diagnoses, personality traits measured with the NEO Personality Inventory - Revised (NEO-PI-R), and temperaments composed of NEO-PI-R facets were examined. Results: There were no differences between groups in demographics, mean DHI or HADS-anxiety scores, or DSM-IV diagnoses. The CSD group had higher mean HADS-depression and NEO-PI-R trait anxiety, but lower NEO-PI-R extraversion, warmth, positive emotions, openness to feelings, and trust (all p < 0.05). CSD subjects were significantly more likely than comparison subjects to have a composite temperament of high trait anxiety plus low warmth or excitement seeking. Conclusion: An anxious, introverted temperament is strongly associated with CSD and may be a risk factor for developing this syndrome. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

One year later, participants reported again on their family satisfaction. Structural equation modelling analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings - As hypothesized, work engagement was positively related to work-family facilitation, which, in turn, predicted own and partner's family satisfaction, also one year later. In contrast, workaholism showed a positive relationship with work-family conflict, and had an indirect negative effect on own and partner's family satisfaction. The structural relationships between the variables from husbands to wives were similar to those from wives to husbands. Research limitations/implications - The use of a non-experimental design does not allow for definitive conclusions regarding causality. Practical implications - The findings contribute to the work-family interface literature by showing how experiences built up at work can have a positive or negative impact on one's partner's family satisfaction. The study highlights a growing need to promote work engagement and discourage workaholism within organizations since engagement has positive and workaholism has negative implications for employees' private life.

Two experiments tested the hypothesis that structural changes in the situation of interdependence lead high and low self-esteem people to reverse their typical responses to risk. When partners were instrumental to a current goal pursuit (and participants were more dependent on the rewards partners could offer), highs drew closer and lows distanced when risk was primed. However, when partners were not instrumental to an active goal (and participants were less dependent on the rewards partners could offer), these responses were reversed. Reducing one's dependence on a partner to attain one's personal goals appears to reduce highs' incentive to connect, whereas it appears to increase lows' incentive to connect.","2014-01","2018-12-21 18:11:09","2018-12-21 18:11:09","","57-69","","1","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","close relationships; instrumentality; interdependence; self-esteem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One possibility is that some people might ruminate in response to deficits in emotional clarity because not knowing how they feel might be intolerable to them. We tested the hypothesis that the relationship between low emotional clarity and rumination would be moderated by intolerance of ambiguity. Participants in a longitudinal online study (N = 195) provided self-reports of intolerance of ambiguity and rumination and reported state emotional clarity following an idiographic mood induction; three weeks later they reported on rumination again. As predicted, participants with low emotional clarity at Time 1 ruminated more three weeks later, but only if they were intolerant of ambiguity. Findings support the notion that rumination sometimes functions as a search for answers about emotions. We discuss implications for understanding the affective disturbances perpetuating vicious cycles of rumination and for rumination-focused clinical interventions. (C) Copyright 2014 Textrum Ltd.

More recently, rumination has been examined within the context of anger, and findings have suggested that ruminating about anger-inducing events heightens or maintains anger and increases aggression. Given these unhelpful effects, why do people ruminate in response to anger? The current experiment examined the potential role of positive beliefs about rumination in maintaining this process. We tested the hypothesis that positive beliefs about ruminating in response to anger-provoking events would lead to increased levels of anger and aggression. Participants engaged in cognitive bias modification (CBM) training intended to induce positive or negative beliefs about rumination. Next, they were presented with anger-provoking scenarios and asked to rate their predicted levels of anger and aggression in response to these scenarios. After CBM training, all participants showed a positive belief bias towards rumination; however, this bias was more pronounced in the positive beliefs condition. Unexpectedly, participants in the positive beliefs condition predicted that they would have lower levels of anger than participants in the negative beliefs condition, although this difference was reduced to a trend when implicit preference for emotional expression was controlled. The unexpected findings suggest novel testable hypotheses, for which concrete suggestions are provided. (C) Copyright 2014 Textrum Ltd.

Method: Data were analyzed from 68 socially anxious participants who performed an initial public speech, and were randomly assigned to an Elaborated VF condition (VF plus cognitive preparation and cognitive review), a Standard VF condition (VF plus cognitive preparation) or a No VF condition (exposure alone), and then performed a second speech. Results: As hypothesized, when appearance concerns were low, both participants who received Elaborated and Standard VF were significantly less anxious during speech 2 than those in the No VF condition.

Individual differences in negative urgency (i.e., the tendency to act impulsively during distress), are associated with eating pathology, but very few studies have examined the interaction of negative mood states and negative urgency on disordered eating. The current study tested the hypothesis that the influence of negative moods on disordered eating would be strengthened by individual differences in negative urgency, and examined the potential moderating effects of this relationship by sex. Structural equation modeling was used in a sample of 884 undergraduate men and women to test whether or not the relationships between urgency and affect were invariant across sex. Negative urgency did not strengthen the association between mood states and disordered eating. Additionally, associations between negative urgency, affect, and eating pathology differed by gender. Individual differences in both negative urgency and mood states made unique contributions to binge eating, but negative urgency contributed significant variance to other disordered eating symptoms only for women.

This investigation is the first to test the hypotheses that grandiose narcissism predicts withholding help under high social pressure, whereas vulnerable narcissism predicts withholding help under low social pressure. Undergraduate participants (N = 220, M-age = 19.5, 142 women) were partnered with a confederate for the supposed purpose of a mock counseling session. The confederate ruined the session by demonstrating inconsiderate behavior, after which the participant encountered two opportunities to help the confederate: one presented under high social pressure to help, the other presented under low social pressure to help. Measures also assessed participants' prosocial emotions, including empathy for and forgiveness of the confederate. Consistent with hypotheses, grandiose narcissism predicted less helping under high social pressure, whereas vulnerable narcissism predicted less helping under low social pressure, the latter relationship being mediated by reduced forgiveness. Vulnerable narcissism was also associated with less empathy and forgiveness. Grandiose and vulnerable narcissism differentially predicted helping behavior depending on the amount of social pressure to help. These results conform to theoretical distinctions between grandiosity and vulnerability regarding social dominance and internalization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Research data strongly suggests that using this feedback informed treatment improves the outcome of therapy. However, until now, this method of Miller and Duncan has only been examined in clients (generally students) with mild problems and in partner counselling. The question addressed by this study is whether immediate feedback is also effective when applied during crisis intervention and subsequent brief therapy in a psychiatric patient population in emergency situations. It also looks at whether `feedback- informed treatment' affects the quality of the alliance. Method/Design: To test the hypotheses, all patients seeking help from the Crisis Intervention & Brief Therapy Team over a two-year period will be followed throughout their treatment up to a maximum of six months and a follow-up period of three months after ending the treatment. Patients are randomly assigned to two conditions: treatment without feedback and treatment with immediate feedback for each session. The therapists all operate in both conditions and so they deliver both treatments. An estimated total of 180 patients, aged 18 years and over, will be included in the study. Discussion: The aim of this study is to make clear whether, and to what extent, systematic feedback from the patient in this target group during therapy determines the course and outcomes of therapy. We also look at whether, and to what extent, the quality of the alliance and the motivation of the person delivering treatment with respect to the instruments play a role.","2013-12-05","2018-12-21 18:11:15","2018-12-21 18:11:15","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Crisis intervention; Efficacy; Outcome monitoring; Patient feedback; Randomized controlled trial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested these hypotheses in five participants who had structural, perfusion, and functional imaging utilizing spelling, reading, word generation, and picture naming tasks at acute and subsequent stages after ischaemic stroke.

Competitors are automatically primed through spreading activation within the lexicon, but competition may be increased by the prior presentation of related items: the semantic interference effect. This has been demonstrated in tasks in which pictures grouped by semantic category are compared to unrelated pictures (blocked naming) and in tasks involving successive naming of items from the same semantic category (continuous naming). Such highly structured tasks may not be representative of the processes at work under more natural word retrieval conditions. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective examination of naming latencies from a randomized picture naming task containing a wide variety of items and categories. Our large sample of adults, ranging in age from 22 to 89 years, also allowed us to test the hypothesis that older adults, who are particularly susceptible to word-retrieval problems, experience increased difficulty resolving competition among lexical items. Semantic interference effects were evident in the interaction between semantic category and order of presentation within a blockmiscellaneous items were named more quickly, whereas related items were named more slowly. This interference effect did not vary with participant age, contrary to the hypothesis that older adults are more susceptible to semantic interference.","2013-12-01","2018-12-21 18:11:16","2018-12-21 18:11:16","","495-506","","7-8, SI","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Ageing; Lexical access; Picture naming; Semantic interference; Word retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the extent to which abnormal LoA alone might predict delirium and inattention is unclear. Here we tested the hypotheses that (1) patients with abnormal LoA have delirium, and (2) abnormal LoA is associated with worse performance on tests of attention. Methods: Thirty acute hip fracture patients aged 64-97 years underwent assessments of LoA, delirium status, and attentional functioning in the 24 hours before surgery and at 2-4 and 7-10 days after surgery. The Observational Scale of Level of Arousal (OSLA) and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) were used to assess LoA. Sustained attention was measured with the Edinburgh Delirium Test Box. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method and the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98. Results: Ten patients (33%) were diagnosed with delirium. Abnormal LoA as measured by the OSLA was strongly associated with the presence of delirium. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.97), with a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.81. Area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity for the RASS were 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.68-0.94), 0.80, and 0.79, respectively. Abnormal LoA was associated with worse attentional deficits preoperatively and at postoperative days 2-4 (p < 0.01). Conclusion: These exploratory findings suggest that abnormal LoA is a strong indicator of delirium. Also, abnormal LoA is strongly associated with inattention as measured by an objective cognitive test. These findings suggest that acute-onset abnormal LoA could be used as a trigger for delirium assessment in routine clinical practice. Future work will help to clarify further the interrelationships among abnormal LoA, inattention, and delirium.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:17","2018-12-21 18:11:17","","1244-1253","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","arousal; attention; cognition; Delirium; orthopedic surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attentional biases also develop for stimuli that have been paired with nondrug rewards in adults without a history of addiction, the magnitude of which is predicted by visual working-memory capacity and impulsiveness. We tested the hypothesis that addiction is associated with an increased attentional bias for nondrug (monetary) reward relative to that of healthy controls, and that this bias is related to working-memory impairments and increased impulsiveness. Seventeen patients receiving methadone-maintenance treatment for opioid dependence and 17 healthy controls participated. Impulsiveness was measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11; Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995), visual working-memory capacity was measured as the ability to recognize briefly presented color stimuli, and attentional bias was measured as the magnitude of response time slowing caused by irrelevant but previously reward-associated distractors in a visual-search task. The results showed that attention was biased toward the distractors across all participants, replicating previous findings. It is important to note, this bias was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls and was negatively correlated with visual working-memory capacity. Patients were also significantly more impulsive than controls as a group.

Margin of stability (MS) at touchdown was investigated using a full body and a reduced kinematic model. After the perturbation, all age groups showed a lower MS compared to non-perturbed gait (baseline), leading to negative MS. Four old-aged adults failed to cope with the task (only preventing a fall by grasping). The remaining ten old-aged and the middle-aged subjects required three more recovery steps than the young-aged adults to get back to baseline MS. Moreover, there were no differences between kinematic models, and both methods demonstrated similar age-related findings. We concluded that the ability to control dynamic stability during perturbed walking by enlarging the base of support has already begun to deteriorate by middle age. Further, the valid agreement between kinematic models shows that such differences can be assessed by using just four body markers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that neurodegeneration and neuronal density in brainstem aminergic nuclei are related to late-life depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND EXPOSURE Longitudinal clinicopathological cohort study at residences of participants in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area. Participants included 124 older persons without dementia in the Rush Memory and Aging Project who had annual evaluations for a mean (SD) of 5.7 (2.8) years, died, and underwent a postmortem neuropathological examination that provided estimates of the densities of Lewy bodies, neurofibrillary tangles, and aminergic neurons in the locus ceruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The number of depressive symptoms (mean [SD], 1.61 [1.48]; range, 0-6; skewness, 0.94) on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale averaged across annual evaluations. RESULTS Brainstem Lewy bodies were associated with depressive symptoms, and the association was attenuated in those taking antidepressant medication. Brainstem tangles were associated with more depressive symptoms in those without cognitive impairment but with fewer symptoms in those with mild cognitive impairment. Lower density of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the ventral tegmental area was robustly associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms (mean [SE] estimate, -0.014 [0.003]; P < .001; 16.3% increase in adjusted R-2). The association was not modified by medication use or cognitive impairment. Neither tyrosine hydroxlyase-immunoreactive neurons in the locus ceruleus nor tryptophan hydroxlyase-immunoreactive neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus were related to depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results suggest that the mesolimbic dopamine system, especially the ventral tegmental area, has an important role in late-life depressive symptoms.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:19","2018-12-21 18:11:19","","1320-1328","","12","70","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants (N = 581) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Memory and Aging Project (MAP). Longitudinal measures of cognition were derived from detailed annual neuropsychological testing. Uniform neuropathologic evaluations provided quantitative measures of AD pathology, chronic cerebral infarctions, and Lewy bodies. Participants with 1 or more copies of the epsilon 4 allele (epsilon 2/4 excluded) were considered epsilon 4 carriers. Random change point models were applied to examine the association of the epsilon 4 allele with onset of terminal decline as well as preterminal and terminal slopes. On average, the onset of terminal decline occurred around 3 years before death, and the rate of terminal decline was eightfold faster than the preterminal decline. The presence of the epsilon 4 allele was associated with an earlier onset of terminal decline and faster rates of decline before and after its onset. After adjusting for AD pathology, the epsilon 4 allele was no longer associated with onset of terminal decline or preterminal slope, and the association with terminal slope became marginal. The APOE epsilon 4 allele is an important determinant of late-life change in cognition, including terminal decline, and works primarily through AD pathology.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:20","2018-12-21 18:11:20","","1015-1023","","4","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","APOE epsilon 4; cognitive change; neuropathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results suggest that individuals are faster to harshly punish criminals who appear to be angry, and that this effect emerges early in the decision-making process. Black criminals receive quicker punitive responses, but the effect of ethnicity is weakened at high levels of perceived anger. The results are discussed in terms of associative processes linking anger to punishment, the human ability to simulate and experience others' emotional responses, and the role of anger in eliciting hostile aggression.

There has, however, been little attempt to test relationships between these concepts, but this could be useful because of the high prevalence of schizophrenia among people in forensic mental health services and evidence that the DAE may be a useful predictor of violent behaviour. AimsOur primary aim was to explore possible correlations between DAE and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and to test the hypotheses that the DAE would differentiate people with and without personality disorder co-morbidity in a sample with psychosis and, separately, people with main diagnoses of personality disorder or schizophrenia. MethodOn the basis of an interview and a review of institutional files, DAE total and facet scores were calculated and compared with scores on the negative symptom scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale among forensic and general psychiatric patients. Partial correlation and rank order coefficients were calculated. ResultsWe found no correlation between total DAE scores and total negative Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores among patients with psychosis, suggesting that the concepts probably do not overlap. Our hypotheses on diagnostic associations with the DAE were partially sustained. DAE scores differentiated psychosis and personality disorder groups but did not differentiate psychosis groups with and without personality pathology. Conclusions and implicationsThis study, using typical clinical samples, suggested that one aspect of the affective disturbance of schizophrenia has little in common with the deficient emotional experience of psychopath. Measurement of DAE is unlikely to help detect co-morbid personality disorder among people with psychosis, but given our small sample size and the rarity of study in this field, further research would be warranted, perhaps also including a measure of incongruity of affect.

The authors tested the hypothesis that individuals with schizophrenia exhibit microvascular abnormality and evaluated the utility of retinal imaging as a tool for schizophrenia research. Method: Participants were members of the Dunedin Study; a population-representative cohort followed from birth with 95% retention. Study members underwent retinal imaging at age 38. The authors assessed retinal arteriolar and venular caliber for all members of the cohort, including individuals who developed schizophrenia: Results: Study members who developed schizophrenia were distinguished by wider retinal venules, suggesting Microvascular abnormality reflective of insufficient brain oxygen supply. Analyses that controlled for confounding health conditions suggested that wider retinal venules are not simply an artifact of co-occurring health problems in schizophrenia patients. Wider venules were also associated with a dimensional measure of adult psychosis symptoms and with psychosis symptoms reported in childhood. Conclusions: The findings provide initial support for the hypothesis that individuals with schizophrenia show microvascular abnormality. Moreover, the results suggest that the same vascular mechanisms underlie subthreshold symptoms and clinical disorder and that these associations may begin early in life.

Pain acceptance, which involves responding to pain and related experiences without attempts to control or avoid them (pain willingness), and pursuit of valued life activities regardless of pain (activity engagement) has been associated with various favorable outcomes in chronic pain patients, including better psychological functioning. The study presented here tested the hypotheses that pain acceptance is associated with less psychological distress, higher psychological well-being, and reduced self-regulatory fatigue in temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients, particularly for those with longer pain duration. Methods: Cross-sectional data were provided by 135 TMD patients during an initial evaluation at a university-based tertiary orofacial pain clinic. Results: Results of hierarchical linear regression models indicated that, controlling for pain severity, pain willingness is associated with less psychological distress and lower self-regulatory fatigue, and activity engagement is associated with greater psychological well-being. Furthermore, the effect of pain willingness on psychological distress was moderated by pain duration such that pain willingness was more strongly associated with less psychological distress in patients with longer pain duration; this moderating effect was fully mediated by self-regulatory fatigue. Conclusion: These findings suggest pain willingness may buffer against self-regulatory fatigue in those with longer pain duration, and such conservation of self-regulatory resources may protect against psychological symptoms.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:27","2018-12-21 18:11:27","","1236-1239","","12","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","chronic pain; pain acceptance; psychological distress; psychological well-being; self-regulatory fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study sought to test the hypothesis that synchrony limits listeners' ability to separate sound streams. To test this hypothesis, both perceptual-organization judgments and performance measures were used. In Experiment 1, listeners indicated whether they perceived sequences of alternating or synchronous tones as a single stream or as two streams. In Experiments 2 and 3, listeners detected rare changes in the intensity of “target” tones at one frequency in the presence of synchronous or asynchronous random-intensity “distractor” tones at another frequency. The results of these experiments showed that, for large frequency separations between the tones, the probability of perceiving two streams was lower on average for synchronous than for alternating tones, and that sensitivity to intensity changes in the target sequence was greater for asynchronous than for synchronous distractors. Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that synchrony limits listeners' ability to form separate streams and/or to attend selectively to certain sounds in the presence of other sounds, even when the target and distractor sounds are well separated from each other in frequency.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:27","2018-12-21 18:11:27","","1568-1580","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","auditory stream; perceptual organization; stream segregation; temporal coherence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of previous research demonstrating benefits of family contact for African-American adults with severe mental illness, it was hypothesized that frequent family contact would moderate (enhance) a positive association between competitive employment and global quality of life for a rural sample of predominantly African-American adults. Methods: In a secondary analysis of data collected from a randomized trial of supported employment, a series of nested random regression analyses was conducted to test the hypothesized moderating effect of face-to-face family contact on the association between competitive employment and global quality of life, controlling for severity of psychiatric symptoms and satisfaction with family relations. Results: Most of the 143 study participants spent time with a family member at least once a month (80%) and most at least weekly (60%). Participants who held a competitive job and had face-to-face contact with family members at least weekly reported higher global quality of life than all other study participants. Conclusions: In this rural sample of African-American adults with severe mental illness, competitive work was associated with higher global quality of life only for those who frequently spent time with family members. Research is needed to test the generalizability of this finding to other geographic settings and cultures, as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of formal inclusion of family members in psychosocial rehabilitation interventions.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:29","2018-12-21 18:11:29","","1218-1224","","12","64","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A separate line of work indicates these two domains are normally distributed throughout the population, with autism representing an extremity. This realisation brings the Kanner debate into the realm of normative co-variation, providing more ways to test the hypothesis, and insights into typical development; for instance, in the context of normative functioning, the Kanner hypothesis implies social costs to spatial/numerical prowess. In light of this growing body of research, we review relevant factor analytic and correlational, behavioural studies. Findings are then synthesised into three themes: an alternative triad of primary autistic trait categories - Social Interaction Deficits, Cognitive Inflexibility, and Sensory Abnormalities - that more accurately reflects the factor structure of autistic traits; continuity between clinical and non-clinical autism-spectrum trait presentation; and indications that although social and non-social autistic traits may be initially independent, Kanner-like co-variance emerges behaviourally from dynamic trait interactions over the course of development. A dynamic developmental model subsuming these patterns is offered, and its advantages demonstrated in a novel account of ritualistic behaviours: as developmentally emergent, compensatory mechanisms for interactions between cognitive inflexibility and sensory abnormalities. We conclude with the broader imperative that behavioural scientists appealing for directly and exclusively genetic links may instead benefit from a developmental framing within their own discipline.

Method We conducted a 12-month follow-up study of 235 adolescent girls (M-age=13.2 years, SD=0.4) from 12 secondary schools located in low-income communities. At baseline, participants completed SCT scales related to physical activity (i.e., self-efficacy, intention, parental support, and outcome expectations). At baseline and 12-month follow-up (postintervention), participants wore accelerometers for 7 days. Structural equation modeling was used to determine if Time 1 measures predicted physical activity at 12-month follow-up after adjusting for baseline activity. Results The model explained 28% and 34% of the variance in physical activity and intention, respectively. Model fit indexes indicated the data were a good fit to the model; however, only self-efficacy was associated with physical activity at 12 months. There was no support for intention or outcome expectations as proximal determinants of behavior. Self-efficacy was associated with outcome expectations and parental support; however, only outcome expectations predicted intention. Conclusions Current findings indicate a large proportion of the variance for physical activity and intention remains unexplained and that the proposed pathways in the SCT model were not fully supported. Future model testing may need to consider augmentation or integration of theoretical models, which may include ecological components if we are to advance our understanding of physical activity behavior in this subgroup of the adolescent population.","2013-12-01","2018-12-21 18:11:30","2018-12-21 18:11:30","","483-491","","4","84","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","accelerometer; health behavior; self-efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study examined affect consciousness (AC) in patients with APD compared to borderline personality disorder (BPD). AC, defined as capacity to perceive, reflect on, tolerate, and express emotional experiences, is assumed to be central to structure-building in personality. The study tested the hypotheses that patients with APD have lower general AC and lower AC for pleasant affects compared to BPD. Fifty-nine patients, 26 with APD and 33 with BPD were rated on several aspects of AC using the specialized AC interview. The structured interview SCID-II was applied for diagnostic evaluations. The APD group had significantly lower levels of global AC and conceptual expressivity compared to the BPD group. Among 11 specific affects the APD group had significantly lower AC for interest and contempt. Emotional dysfunction is an important feature of APD and the findings indicate that psychotherapies for APD patients should focus on emotional experiences, aiming to improve emotional awareness, tolerance, and expressivity. The notion of a general avoidance of positive emotions in APD needs further exploration, including a possible dysfunction in the evolutionary based neuro-affective Seeking system.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:31","2018-12-21 18:11:31","","515-521","","6","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affect; Affect consciousness; avoidant personality disorder; borderline personality disorder; emotion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study tests the hypothesis that marital status, perceived social support and neighborhood collective efficacy can moderate the effects of economic adversity on depressive symptoms among parents. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was used to analyze data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Participants were 1,957 mothers of minor children. Analysis of main effects revealed associations between neighborhood SES (beta = -0.69, SE (0.15), p < .001), family income (beta = -0.11, SE (0.05), p = .02) financial strain (beta = 0.51, SE (0.18), p = .004), being single (beta = 0.63, SE (0.24), p = .009) and perceived social support (beta = -0.22, SE (0.03), p < .001) on depressive symptoms. The hypothesis that interpersonal resources can buffer the effects of economic adversity was not supported. There were no significant interactions between marital status and economic adversity. There was a significant interaction between perceived social support and neighborhood level socioeconomic status (beta = -0.07, SE (0.03), p = .04) but the effects of social support were weakest in neighborhoods characterized by low socioeconomic status.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:32","2018-12-21 18:11:32","","359-366","","3-4","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Depression; Marital status; Neighborhood collective efficacy; Parents; Poverty; Social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that affective temperaments might differ according to co-occurring mood disorders among patients with alcohol and/or opiate dependence; to explore the relationship between temperaments and dual substance use disorders (SUDs, alcohol and other drugs). Ninety-two patients attending an alcohol addiction treatment facility and 47 patients in an opiate addiction treatment facility were assessed for SUDs, mood disorders and affective temperaments using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego 39-item auto-questionnaire. Comparison of patients with bipolar disorder, depressive unipolar disorder and no (or substance-induced) mood disorder revealed significant differences for the cyclothymic subscale, with highest scores among patients with bipolar disorder. No difference was observed for the depressive, irritable, hyperthymic and anxious subscales. After adjustment for age, gender and bipolar disorder, irritable temperament was a significant risk factor for past or present history of drug use disorders in patients treated for alcohol addiction (odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.93). Anxious temperament was a significant risk factor for history of alcohol use disorders in patients treated for opiate addiction (OR 3.30, 95 % CI 1.36-7.99), whereas the hyperthymic subscale appeared as a significant protective factor (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.42-0.99).

Significant others differentially contribute to the perceived satisfaction of basic psychological needs. God is a significant Other for Christians, but there is no published research investigating perceptions of God meeting basic psychological needs. This paper considers psychological and theological evidence concerning Christian perceptions that God could meet basic psychological needs. It reports evidence from a study of 225 Australian Christians testing the hypotheses that: (1) God will be perceived as meeting basic psychological needs uniquely in the context of significant others meeting needs, and (2) attributions to God meeting basic psychological needs will be negatively related to psychological ill-health. Results suggest that God is perceived as meeting basic psychological needs to a small but significant extent in the context of the effects of significant human figures. Further, lower symptoms of depression and stress are reported when God is perceived to meet needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness. The study provides preliminary evidence that God's perceived capacity to meet basic psychological has not only theoretical and theological interest, but also practical psychological interest as well.","2013","2018-12-21 18:11:37","2018-12-21 18:11:37","","298-314","","4","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These methods are relevant, for example, when comparing groups based on a Likert scale, which was the motivation for the paper. In essence, the goal is to test the hypothesis that the cell probabilities associated with two independent multinomial distributions are equal. Both a global test and a multiple comparison procedure are proposed. The small-sample properties of both methods are compared to four other techniques via simulations: Cliff's generalization of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test that effectively deals with heteroscedasticity and tied values, Yuen's test based on trimmed means, Welch's test and Student's t test. For the simulations, data were generated from beta-binomial distributions. Both symmetric and skewed distributions were used. The sample space consisted of the integers 0(1)4 or 0(1)10. For the global test that is proposed, when testing at the 0.05 level, simulation estimates of the actual Type I error probability ranged between 0.043 and 0.059. For the new multiple comparison procedure, the estimated family wise error rate ranged between 0.031 and 0.054 for the sample space 0(1)4. But for 0(1)10, the estimates dropped as low as 0.016 in some situations. Given the goal of comparing means, Student's t is well known to have practical problems when distributions differ. Similar problems are found here among the situations considered. No single method dominates in terms of power, as would be expected, because different methods are sensitive to different features of the distributions being compared. But in general, one of the new methods tends to have relatively good power based on both simulations and experience with data from actual studies. If, however, there is explicit interest in comparing means, rather than comparing the cell probabilities, Welch's test was found to perform well. The new methods are illustrated using data from the Well-Elderly Study where the goal is to compare groups in terms of depression and the strategies used for dealing with stress.","2013-12","2018-12-21 18:11:37","2018-12-21 18:11:37","","1583-1595","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hochberg's method; Likert scales; Multinomial distribution; Storer-Kim method; Yuen's method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined team debriefing, an intervention in which team members reflect on recent experiences to prepare for subsequent tasks. Prior researchers have shown that facilitated team debriefs work, but they have not examined how to enable teams to conduct their own debriefs or studied how debriefs affect individual level outcomes. Therefore, we compared 2 team-led debriefing techniques: (a) an unguided debrief and (b) a guided debrief designed to incorporate lessons learned from prior debriefs. We collected data from 174 business students who were members of 35 teams from 9 sections of a Strategic Management course. Class sections were randomly assigned to one of the debriefing conditions, and teams completed 4 business cases over 10 weeks. A multilevel design was employed and a multistage model building approach was used to test the hypotheses using hierarchical linear modeling techniques. Results of this cluster randomized, quasi-experimental design suggest that the team-led guided debrief intervention resulted in superior team processes as compared to the unguided debriefing method. Team processes, in turn, related significantly to greater team performance and increased individual readiness for teamwork and enthusiasm for teaming.

Clients who wanted their counselor to pray with them in session had higher self-reported levels of spirituality and religious commitment. Clients who preferred to have their counselor encourage out-of-session prayer had mid-range levels of spirituality and religious commitment. Clients who preferred not to have prayer mentioned during their counseling session had lower levels of spirituality and religious commitment. Answers to open-ended questions identified that many clients found prayer to be helpful and important, but preferred not to integrate it in their counseling sessions. Clients who do not believe in a higher power indicated that prayer in their counseling sessions would be inappropriate, unhelpful, and awkward. Implications for future research are explored.","2013-11","2018-12-21 18:11:41","2018-12-21 18:11:41","","325-334","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","counseling; prayer; religion; spirituality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implicit and Explicit Self-Associations Following Recurrent Depressive Episodes","JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY","","0021-843X","10.1037/a0034933","","To help explain the recurrent nature of major depressive disorder, we tested the hypothesis that depressive episodes and/or the duration of depressive symptoms may give rise to persistent dysfunctional implicit and/or more explicit self-associations, which in turn may place people at risk for the recurrence of symptoms. We therefore examined, in the context of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, whether the strength of self-depressed associations at baseline was related to the number of past episodes (retrospective analysis; n = 666), and whether the duration of symptoms between baseline and follow-up predicted self-depressed associations at 2-year follow-up (prospective analysis; n = 726). The lifetime Composite International Diagnostic Interviews and Life Chart Interview were used to index the number of depressive episodes; the Implicit Association Test and its explicit equivalent were used to index self-associations. Consistent with the hypothesis that self-depressed associations strengthen following prolonged activation of negative self-associations during depressive episodes, individuals' implicit and explicit self-depressed associations correlated positively both with the number of prior depressive episodes at baseline and with the duration of depressive symptoms between baseline and 2-year follow-up. There was evidence that these relationships held, particularly in the prospective study, even when controlling for neuroticism and current depressive symptoms, whereas the retrospective relationship between number of episodes and implicit self-associations fell just short of significance.","2013-11","2018-12-21 18:11:42","2018-12-21 18:11:42","","951-960","","4","122","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","depression; explicit self-depressed associations; implicit self-depressed associations; longitudinal study; recurrence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we test the hypothesis that the antisaccade deficit in PSZ reflects dysfunctional magnocellular processing rather than impaired cognitive processing, as indexed by working memory capacity. This is a plausible hypothesis because oculomotor regions have direct magnocellular inputs, and the stimuli used in most antisaccade tasks strongly activate the magnocellular visual pathway. In the current study, we examined both prosaccade and antisaccade performance in PSZ (N = 22) and matched healthy control subjects (HCS; N = 22) with Gabor stimuli designed to preferentially activate the magnocellular pathway, the parvocellular pathway, or both pathways. We also measured working memory capacity. PSZ exhibited impaired antisaccade performance relative to HCS across stimulus types, with impairment even for stimuli that minimized magnocellular activation. Although both sensory thresholds and working memory capacity were impaired in PSZ, only working memory capacity was correlated with antisaccade accuracy, consistent with a cognitive rather than sensory origin for the antisaccade deficit.","2013-11","2018-12-21 18:11:43","2018-12-21 18:11:43","","1111-1120","","4","122","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","antisaccade; eye movements; magnocellular pathway; schizophrenia; working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is suggested that somatosensory afferents inform the brain about the deviation (P) of body segments from the centrally set referent position. To perceive the actual position (Q) of body segments and form the position sense (PS), the central and afferent signals are combined: Q=R+P. In previous studies, the R has been shown to remain invariant during involuntary changes in the wrist position elicited by sudden unloading of muscles, suggesting that only the afferent component is responsible for the PS during this reflex. In contrast, the central PS component, R, is predominantly responsible for PS during intentional motion in isotonic conditions. We tested the hypothesis that the R and P are interchangeable PS components such that involuntary changes in wrist position elicited by the unloading reflex can easily be reproduced by making intentional changes in wrist position in isotonic conditions, in the absence of vision. The PS rule also suggests that PS is independent of sense of effort, which was tested by asking subjects to reproduce elbow joint angles under different constant loads. We also tested the hypothesis that tendon vibration may elicit motion that may not be perceived by subjects (no-motion illusion). These hypotheses were confirmed in three experiments. It is concluded that the R and P are additive components of PS and that, contrary to the conventional view, PS is independent of the sense of effort or efference copy. The PS rule also explains kinesthetic illusions and the phantom limb phenomenon. This study advances the understanding of action perception coupling in kinesthesia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Such anticipations can be contextualized in the sense that response-effect relationships in one stimulus context are inverted in another stimulus context The primary study aim was to test the hypothesis that contextualized effect anticipation might depend on whether subjects adopt either an effect-based action control style or a stimulus-based control style. Importantly, we hypothesized that the choice of control styles depends on explicit instruction. Effect anticipation during response selection was determined by assessing the behavioral impact of spatial compatibility between the required response and an additional task-irrelevant spatial feature attached to the anticipated effect that would be produced by that response in a given context. In two experiments we found a compatibility effect exclusively in blocks with effect-based instruction but not in stimulus-based blocks. Furthermore, subjects could quickly switch between styles without one strategy dominating the others. Together, this shows that contextualized anticipation of distal visual effects is not an automatic process but depends on the intention to produce an effect.

Phobic participants identified both detected and undetected spiders better than chance, as assessed by two measures of response bias.

This study tested the hypothesis that the effects of impulsivity (sensation seeking and negative urgency) on smoking initiation in a sample of college students (n = 400) would be mediated by alcohol consumption. We also predicted that sensation seeking and negative urgency would predict alcohol and cigarette use and overlap among initiators. Sensation seeking and negative urgency both predicted smoking initiation, but only the former effect was mediated by alcohol use. Among initiators, sensation seeking was associated with more frequent alcohol use as well as more frequent overlap between alcohol and tobacco use but not with smoking frequency. Higher negative urgency was associated with more frequent smoking, but not with alcohol use or alcohol/tobacco overlap.

The presence of dysgenic fertility for IQ amongst Western nations, starting in the 19th century, suggests that these trends might be related to declining IQ. This is because high-IQ people are more productive and more creative. We tested the hypothesis that the Victorians were cleverer than modern populations, using high-quality instruments, namely measures of simple visual reaction time in a meta-analytic study. Simple reaction time measures correlate substantially with measures of general intelligence (g) and are considered elementary measures of cognition. In this study we used the data on the secular slowing of simple reaction time described in a meta-analysis of 14 age-matched studies from Western countries conducted between 1889 and 2004 to estimate the decline in g that may have resulted from the presence of dysgenic fertility. Using psychometric meta-analysis we computed the true correlation between simple reaction time and g, yielding a decline of -1.16 IQ points per decade or -13.35 IQ points since Victorian times. These findings strongly indicate that with respect to g the Victorians were substantially cleverer than modern Western populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Takahashi translated DOSPERT to Japanese but DOSPERT responses from Japan have never been reported. Butler et al. (2012) developed an additional medical risk domain subscale to be added to DOSPERT to form DOSPERT+M. Objective: To describe the translation of the medical risk domain subscale to Japanese and to characterize domain-specific risk attitudes in Tokyo. Methods: Members of a probability-weighted online panel representative of the Tokyo metro area were randomized to complete pairs of DOSPERT+M tasks (risk attitude, risk perception, benefit perception). We explored relationships among domains through correlational and factor analysis; we tested the hypothesis that the medical risk domain and DOSPERT's health/safety domains were uncorrelated. Participants: One hundred eighty panelists. Results: Six of the original DOSPERT items (two each in the ethics, health/safety, and financial domains) are not useable in Japan according to the Japanese Marketing Research Association code because they ask about participation in illegal activities; we thus used abbreviated versions of those domains leaving out these items. The DOSPERT+M items generally did not cluster cleanly into the expected domains, although items within the same domain usually were intercorrelated. Participants demonstrated domain-specific conventional risk attitudes, although nearly half of those assessed were perceived-risk neutral in all domains. Unlike our recently reported findings in the U. S. population, DOSPERT+M medical domain scores were associated with health/safety domain scores, although they were often more strongly associated with scores in other domains, such as recreational activities.

In addition, existent findings are mixed, making it difficult to know how individuals' PTSD symptoms will change from week to week during psychotherapy. The study presented here uses general growth mixture modeling (GGMM) to test the hypothesis that multiple latent classes will explain individual differences in PTSD symptom change during the course of cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Participants were 207 U.S. military veterans with PTSD who received CPT through an outpatient Veterans Affairs PTSD treatment program. Participants were mostly male (89%), White (81%), and averaged 42 years old. The PTSD Checklist (PCL), Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were administered at pre- and posttreatment; the PCL was also administered weekly to assess PTSD symptom changes during CPT. GGMM showed that a quadratic growth model with three distinct latent classes best explained the trajectory of PTSD symptom reductions during CPT. The following variables significantly predicted latent class membership: age; ethnicity; having combat as the worst trauma; and pretreatment PCL, CAPS, and BDI-II scores. In turn, class membership significantly predicted posttreatment PCL, BDI-II, and CAPS scores. This study is novel in showing that latent class differences in PTSD symptom reductions are useful in explaining why individuals exhibit variable rates of PTSD symptom change during psychotherapy and differing outcomes after psychotherapy. These findings may improve the ability to more accurately anticipate individual differences in PTSD symptom changes and responses to psychotherapy.","2013-11","2018-12-21 18:11:51","2018-12-21 18:11:51","","536-544","","6","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cognitive processing therapy; cognitive-behavioral therapy; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychotherapy; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then assess the mediating role of brand attachment in the relationship between these three components and brand commitment. We test the hypotheses using a sample of online mobile phone brand communities in China. The empirical results reveal that brand attachment exerts an indirect (but not mediated) effect on the relationship between continuance CC and brand commitment and on the relationship between normative CC and brand commitment. We also find that it exerts a partial mediating effect on the relationship between affective CC and brand commitment.

We propose that the hippocampus, in its capacity for relational binding, representational flexibility, and online maintenance and integration of multimodal relational representations, is a key contributor to language processing. Here we test the hypothesis that the online interpretation of pronouns is hippocampus-dependent. We combined eye tracking with neuropsychological methods, where participants (4 patients with bilateral hippocampal damage and severe declarative memory impairment, 4 patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC] damage, and healthy comparison participants) viewed a scene while listening to short dialogues. introducing 2 characters; for example, Melissa is playing violin for Debbie/Danny as the sun is shining overhead. She is wearing a blue/purple dress. Consistent with previous work, analysis of eye gaze showed that younger and older healthy comparison participants and the vmPFC patients rapidly identified the intended referent of the pronoun when gender uniquely identified the referent, and when it did not, they showed a preference to interpret the pronoun as referring to the first-mentioned character. By contrast, hippocampal patients, while exhibiting a similar gender effect, exhibited significant disruptions in their ability to use information about which character had been mentioned first to interpret the pronoun. This finding suggests that the hippocampus plays a role in maintaining and integrating information even over a very short discourse history. These observed disruptions in referential processing demonstrate how promiscuously the hallmark processing features of the hippocampus are used in service of a variety of cognitive domains including language.","2013-11","2018-12-21 18:11:53","2018-12-21 18:11:53","","1346-1354","","4","142","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","eye tracking; hippocampus; language; referential processing; relational memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested the hypothesis that retrieval would facilitate incorporating a new contextual detail into a learned association. Participants learned 3 pieces of information a person's face, name, and profession (in Experiments 1-5). In the 1st phase, participants in all conditions learned faces and names. In the 2nd phase, participants either restudied the face name pair (the restudy condition) or were given the face and asked to retrieve the name (the test condition). In the 3rd phase, professions were presented for study just after restudy or testing. Our prediction was that the new information (the profession) would be more readily learned following retrieval of the face name association compared to restudy of the face name association. However, we found that the act of retrieval generally undermined acquisition of new associations rather than facilitating them. This detrimental effect emerged on both immediate and delayed tests. Further, the effect was not due to selective attention to feedback because we found impairment whether or not feedback was provided after the Phase 2 test. The data are novel in showing that the act of retrieving information can inhibit the ability to learn new information shortly thereafter. The results are difficult to accommodate within current theories that mostly emphasize benefits of retrieval for learning.","2013-11","2018-12-21 18:11:54","2018-12-21 18:11:54","","1665-1681","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","memory malleability; memory retrieval; updating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) was formed to examine a broad array of intermediate phenotypes across psychotic disorders and to test the hypothesis that intermediate phenotype characteristics are homogeneous within phenomenologically derived DSM-IV diagnoses. Method: The consortium recruited 933 stable probands with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic bipolar I disorder, 1,055 of their first-degree relatives, and 459 healthy comparison subjects for clinical characterization and dense phenotyping. Clinical, psychosocial, and family characteristics were contrasted. Results: All proband groups showed lower psychosocial functioning than the relatives or comparison group. On average, schizophrenia probands showed more symptoms and lower psychosocial functioning than probands with psychotic bipolar disorder, but there was considerable overlap in clinical manifestations. The characteristics of schizoaffective disorder were more often similar to schizophrenia than to psychotic bipolar disorder. The rates of lifetime suicide attempts were high across all proband groups, with the highest reported frequencies in the schizoaffective and bipolar groups. Proband family lineages included both families with “pure” psychosis diagnoses and families with mixed schizophrenia-bipolar diagnoses. Conclusions: Symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and familial lineage overlap across the three DSM-IV psychosis diagnoses used in B-SNIP.

Recognition of the importance of parent-infant interaction for later attachment has underpinned the search for innovative ways of promoting sensitive parent-infant interaction. One such early intervention is infant massage, but a recent review found no evidence of its effectiveness in population samples. This points to the need to identify which parent-infant dyads are potentially able to benefit from such an intervention. This study aimed to identify the contextual factors and program mechanisms that were associated with different outcomes for a group of mother-infant dyads who attended infant massage programs. A Realist mixed-methods research design was used to identify the context, mechanism, and outcome (CMO) patterns across a sample of 39 mother-infant dyads attending infant massage programs. A range of quantitative measures (Working Model of the Child Interview, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and video recordings of mother-infant interaction coded with the CARE-Index) were administered pre- and post-intervention, alongside qualitative observations and interviews with a range of stakeholders. Three key CMO patterns were identified. Women categorized as low risk on the whole showed no change in parent-infant interaction (i.e., because they were already in the adequate range) and limited change in levels of depression, irrespective of the quality of the program attended. Mothers who were categorized as being at moderate risk (i.e., they had one to two risk factors over and above their demographic risk) appeared to require good quality programs (seven or more program mechanisms) for change to occur. Mothers categorized as being at high risk showed no benefits irrespective of the quality of the program, and there was evidence of unresponsive mothers becoming more intrusive. These findings suggest that infant massage programs should be targeted at parents experiencing moderate problems in terms of parent-infant interaction, and that primary care professionals working in a range of settings need the skills to identify such compromised parenting to do this. High-risk mothers appear unlikely to benefit from infant massage alone. Rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence is needed to test the hypotheses raised by this study.","2013-11","2018-12-21 18:11:56","2018-12-21 18:11:56","","483-495","","6","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments 1, 2, and 4 focused on captains and players in either soccer or netball sports competitions. Across studies, transgressive captains of ingroup teams were evaluated more favorably than captains from outgroup teams and (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) more favorably than transgressive ingroup players. Experiment 3 demonstrated the double standard in a minimal group paradigm. Experiment 5 showed that the double standard is only applied if the leader is perceived as serving the group's interest. Across studies, the double standard is evident in evaluations toward, inclusion and punishment of, and rewards to the transgressive targets.

In particular, markedly abnormal expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), key components of the extracellular matrix, was observed in the medial temporal lobe. CSPG functions, including regulation of neuronal differentiation and migration, are highly relevant to the pathophysiology of SZ. CSPGs may exert similar functions in the olfactory epithelium (OE), a continuously regenerating neural tissue that shows cell and molecular abnormalities in SZ. We tested the hypothesis that CSPG expression in OE may be altered in SZ. CSPG-positive cells in postmortem OE from non-psychiatric control (n = 9) and SZ (n = 10) subjects were counted using computer-assisted light microscopy. `Cytoplasmic' CSPG (c-CSPG) labeling was detected in sustentacular cells and some olfactory receptor neurons (c-CSPG + ORNs), while `pericellular' CSPG (p-CSPG) labeling was found in basal cells and some ORNs (p-CSPG + ORNs). Dual labeling for CSPG and markers for mature and immature ORNs suggests that c-CSPG + ORNs correspond to mature ORNs, and p-CSPG + ORNs to immature ORNs. Previous studies in the same cohort demonstrated that densities of mature ORNs were unaltered (Arnold et al., 2001). In the present study, numerical densities of c-CSPG + ORNs were significantly decreased in SZ (p < 0.025; 99.32% decrease), suggesting a reduction of CSPG expression in mature ORNs. Previous studies showed a striking increase in the ratios of immature neurons with respect to basal cells. In this study, we find that the ratio of p-CSPG + ORNs/CSPG + basal cells was significantly increased (p = 0.03) in SZ, while numerical density changes of p-CSPG + ORNs (110.71% increase) or CSPG + basal cells (53.71% decrease), did not reach statistical significance. Together, these results indicate that CSPG abnormalities are present in the OE of SZ and specifically point to a reduction of CSPG expression in mature ORNs in SZ. Given the role CSPGs play in OE cell differentiation and axon guidance, we suggest that altered CSPG expression may contribute to ORN lineage dysregulation, and olfactory identification abnormalities, observed in SZ.

There is an urgent need to test innovative approaches to improve psychosocial and symptom outcomes in this group. This study tested the hypothesis that a tailored, multidisciplinary supportive care programme based on systematic needs assessment would reduce perceived unmet needs and distress and improve quality of life. MethodsA randomised controlled trial design was used. The tailored intervention comprised two sessions at treatment commencement and completion. Sessions included a self-completed needs assessment, active listening, self-care education and communication of unmet psychosocial and symptom needs to the multidisciplinary team for management and referral. Outcomes were assessed with the Needs Assessment for Advanced Lung Cancer Patients, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer and European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Q-C30 V2.0. ResultsOne hundred and eight patients with a diagnosis of inoperable lung or pleural cancer (including mesothelioma) were recruited from a specialist facility before the trial closed prematurely (original target 200). None of the primary contrasts of interest were significant (all p>0.10), although change score analysis indicated a relative benefit from the intervention for unmet symptom needs at 8 and 12weeks post-assessment (effect size=0.55 and 0.40, respectively).

Functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and limbic regions including the ventral striatum, extended amygdala and parahippocampal areas has been previously implicated in the genetics and clinical severity of smoking. In this study, we test the hypothesis that dACC functional circuits are key paths for the high risk of smoking comorbidity in schizophrenia. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed using the dACC as a seed region in smoking and nonsmoking patients with schizophrenia (n = 54), matched controls (n = 65), and nonpsychotic first-degree relatives (n = 24). Multiple regions had decreased connectivity with the dACC in schizophrenia patients when compared with matched controls (n = 65). Several of these functional circuits were also associated with nicotine addiction severity; the largest cluster included limbic areas such as the parahippocampal, extended amygdala, ventral striatal, and posterior insula regions, indicating an overlap of schizophrenia and nicotine addiction on to this circuit. These same functional connectivity-defined circuits were also significantly impaired in schizophrenia nonsmokers compared with control nonsmokers and in nonpsychotic first-degree relatives. Functional connectivity between the dACC and limbic regions is inherently abnormal in schizophrenia, related to its genetic liability regardless of smoking, and overlaps with a nicotine addiction-related circuit. Our findings establish a biologically defined brain circuit mechanism that contributes to the high prevalence of smoking.","2013-11","2018-12-21 18:11:59","2018-12-21 18:11:59","","1373-1381","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anterior cingulate; functional connectivity; limbic; nicotine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These responses are mirrored in deservingness judgments, as enviable individuals' misfortunes are perceived as deserved and those of non-enviable individuals perceived as undeserved. However, the neural underpinnings of these deservingness disparities remain unknown. To explore this phenomenon, we utilized fMRI to test the hypotheses that (A) non-enviable targets' misfortunes would be associated with activation of brain regions that mediate empathic responding (pain matrix, mentalizing network) and not for enviable targets and (B) that activation of those regions would predict decreases in deservingness judgments. Supporting our first hypothesis, the misfortunes of non-enviable targets (as opposed to good fortunes) were associated with activation of the mentalizing network: medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, temporal-parietal junction, and anterior temporal lobes. Supporting our second hypothesis, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation from this contrast was negatively correlated with subsequent reports of how much the non-enviable target deserved his/her misfortune. These findings suggest that non-enviable individuals' misfortunes are perceived as unjust due, in part, to the recruitment of the mentalizing network.","2013-11-01","2018-12-21 18:12:00","2018-12-21 18:12:00","","640-649","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Deservingness; Empathy; Envy; fMRI; Mentalizing network; Misfortune","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, growing evidence suggests that depression with psychotic symptoms (MDP) may represent a distinct subtype of depression. In the course of the search for discriminating factors we tested the hypothesis that the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) may interact with the manifestation of psychotic symptoms in acute depression. Methods: 112 inpatients (61 female) with a depressive episode (16 bipolar, 86 unipolar) at admission were genotyped for 5-HTTLPR variants. Psychotic symptoms und general psychopathology were evaluated comprehensively using the Manual of the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Methodik und Dokumentation in der Psychiatrie, 1981). For statistical analysis a chi-square test and a logistic regression model was used. Results: 16 (14.3%) out of 112 patients were currently presenting with psychotic symptoms. The primary finding of our study was the higher prevalence of the s-allele of the 5-HTTLPR within the group of MDP patients (Pearson chi(2)=7.87; df=2; p < 0.03). Secondly, in a logistic regression model, 5-HTTLPR was found to significantly contribute to the diagnosis of MDP (chi(2)=6.5; df=1; p=0.01). This effect was even more pronounced upon comparing only severely depressed patients with MDP patients. From a psychopathological perspective, MDP patients showed higher AMDP hostility and apathy scores but equal AMDP depression scores. Discussion: This is the first study to show an influence of 5-HTTLPR on psychotic symptoms in acutely depressed patients. Limitations: The lack of a control group and the relatively small sample size limits the present study's findings, thus replication in a larger sample is necessary. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether individuals with poorer perceived sleep quality (rather than sleep efficiency/duration), as measured via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, & Berman, 1989), would have less of a reduction in cannabis use (measured via Timeline FollowBack; Sobell and Sobell, 1992) during the first 6 months following a self-guided quit attempt. We expected these effects to remain significant after adjusting for baseline age, posttraumatic stress symptoms, as well as alcohol, tobacco, and opioid use, and cannabis withdrawal severity over the course of 6 months following the cannabis cessation attempt. Generalized linear mixed modeling using a Poisson distribution was employed to test the hypotheses among 102 cannabis dependent, primarily male, military veterans. Results indicated that veterans with poor perceived sleep quality had less of a reduction in mean cannabis use following a self-guided cannabis cessation attempt compared to those with good perceived sleep quality, while efficiency/duration was unrelated to cannabis use outcomes.

While this principle seems to work well for tasks that require the execution of the same sequence of steps over and over, with little uncertainty about the process, in other cases, especially where creative problem solving is required due to the difficulty in finding the optimal sequence of actions, external rewards can actually be detrimental to task performance. Furthermore, they have the potential to undermine intrinsic motivation to do an otherwise interesting activity. In this work, we extend a computational model of the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatal reinforcement learning systems to account for the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. The model assumes that the brain employs both a goal-directed and a habitual learning system, and competition between both is based on the trade-off between the cost of the reasoning process and value of information. The goal-directed system elicits internal rewards when its models of the environment improve, while the habitual system, being model-free, does not. Our results account for the phenomena that initial extrinsic reward leads to reduced activity after extinction compared to the case without any initial extrinsic rewards, and that performance in complex task settings drops when higher external rewards are promised. We also test the hypothesis that external rewards bias the competition in favor of the computationally efficient, but cruder and less flexible habitual system, which can negatively influence intrinsic motivation and task performance in the class of tasks we consider.","2013-10-16","2018-12-21 18:12:05","2018-12-21 18:12:05","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","extrinsic motivation; intrinsic motivation; model-free vs. model-based learning; reinforcement learning model; striatel models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assessment of schizotypy is primarily based on self-reports, and for this reason it presents several limitations. In order to assess schizotypy, this study proposes a diagnostic instrument based on clinical reports. Methods: A sample of 66 subjects, composed of 25 outpatients with schizophrenia, 18 siblings of these patients and 23 healthy controls, was subjected to the personality assessment test SWAP-200 by trained clinical interviewers. To test the hypothesis of the difference between the profiles of the Personality Disorders within the schizophrenia spectrum, a Multivariate Analysis of Variance and subsequent planned comparisons were conducted. Results: Patients with schizophrenia scored higher than both their siblings and the controls on all SWAP-200 scales; their siblings, compared to the healthy controls, showed significant statistical differences, with higher mean scores for paranoid (F-(1,F-63) = 7.02; p = 0.01), schizoid (F-(1,F-63) = 6.56; p = 0.013) and schizotypal (F-(1,F-63) = 6.47; p = 0.013) traits (PD T scores of Cluster A and Q-factor scores for the schizoid scale [F-(1,F-63) = 6.47; p = 0.013]). Conclusions: Consistent with previous data, first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia scored higher on schizophrenia-related personality traits than a general population comparison sample. SWAP-200, as an alternative diagnostic instrument to self-report measures, is able to reveal the higher prevalence of schizotypal traits in siblings of patients with schizophrenia, suggesting its possible use as a complementary instrument for the assessment of schizophrenia.","2013-10-04","2018-12-21 18:12:06","2018-12-21 18:12:06","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","First-degree relatives; Personality disorders; Schizophrenia; Schizotypy; Siblings; SWAP-200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tested the hypothesis that because time is characterized by perishability, fixed supply, and infungibility, people with strong motivation to obtain a long period of uninterrupted discretionary time would strive to trim the time needed for non-discretionary activities or to combine several non-discretionary activities. As a result, people prefer integration over segregation of multiple time losses or gains, which is not consistent with the prediction based on hedonic editing theory or the renewable resource model. This proposition is supported by results from four experiments.","2013-10","2018-12-21 18:12:07","2018-12-21 18:12:07","","635-646","","2","113","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An ERP Study","MEDIA PSYCHOLOGY","","1521-3269","10.1080/15213269.2013.831394","","The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that during audiovisual message processing (e.g., television or film), cuts in the video track cause an orienting response, which is reflected in the involuntary shift of attention. In classic research by Reeves et al. (1985), changes in the alpha band were noticed in reaction to montage cuts. We propose an investigation of the brain's reaction to montage cuts by means of event-related potentials (ERPs), which are the brain's electrophysiological responses to a stimulus. Well-known indices of orienting response are two ERP components: P3 and slow cortical potential (SCP). Ten participants watched a film consisting of 105 related and 114 unrelated cuts while an electroencephalographic signal was recorded. The hypothesis that unrelated cuts in the video track when watching an audiovisual message cause more pronounced SCP was confirmed. There was no effect of unrelated cuts on P3. The results of this study provide a good starting point for further research on brain reactions to the structural features of an audiovisual message, such as close ups or camera moves.","2013-10-01","2018-12-21 18:12:08","2018-12-21 18:12:08","","461-475","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This theoretical framework predicts that phonologically related phenomena such as the phonological similarity effect (PSE) should occur when the domain-specific system is involved in maintenance, but should disappear when concurrent articulation hinders its use. Impeding maintenance in the domain-general system by a concurrent attentional demand should impair recall performance without affecting PSE. In three experiments, we manipulated the concurrent articulation and the attentional demand induced by the processing component of complex span tasks in which participants had to maintain lists of either similar or dissimilar words. Confirming our predictions, PSE affected recall performance in complex span tasks. Although both the attentional demand and the articulatory requirement of the concurrent task impaired recall, only the induction of an articulatory suppression during maintenance made the PSE disappear. These results suggest a duality in the systems devoted to verbal maintenance in the short term, constraining models of working memory.","2013-10-01","2018-12-21 18:12:08","2018-12-21 18:12:08","","1927-1950","","10","66","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Complex span task; Phonological similarity; Rehearsal; Time-based resource-sharing model; Working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some interventions, such as the Responsive Classroom (RC) approach, explicitly embed this sequence into professional development efforts. We tested the hypothesis that earlier emotional and organizational supports set the stage for improved instruction later in the year in a sample of third- and fourth-grade teachers enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of the RC approach. Further, we examined the extent to which the model generalized for teachers using varying levels of RC practices as well as whether or not teachers were in the intervention or control groups. Teachers' emotional, organizational, and instructional interactions were observed using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008) on five occasions throughout the year. Results indicated a reciprocal relation between emotional and instructional supports. Specifically, higher levels of emotional support earlier in the year predicted higher instructional support later in the year. Also, higher levels of instructional support earlier in the year predicted higher emotional support later in the year. Classroom organization was not found to have longitudinal associations with the other domains across a year. This pattern was robust when controlling for the use of RC practices as well as across intervention and control groups. Further, teachers' use of RC practices predicted higher emotional support and classroom organization throughout the year, suggesting the malleability of this teacher characteristic. Discussion highlights the connection between teachers' emotional and instructional supports and how the use of RC practices improves teachers' emotionally supportive interactions with students.

The focus of previous studies has been on the potentially detrimental consequences of maternal stress on pregnancy and birth outcomes, particularly shortened gestation and increased risk of preterm birth. Despite a growing literature linking positive affect with favorable health outcomes this construct has received little attention in the context of pregnancy. Therefore, in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that maternal positive affect during pregnancy is associated with beneficial consequences in terms of increased length of gestation and reduced risk of preterm birth above that of the absence of stress. Methods: In 169 pregnant women maternal positive affect and perceived stress were serially assessed at 15.2 +/- 0.9 weeks (T1; mean +/- SD), 19.7 +/- 0.9 weeks (12) and 30.7 +/- 0.7 weeks (T3) gestation. Pregnancy and birth outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. Results: Higher maternal positive affect and a steeper increase in maternal positive affect over pregnancy were positively associated with length of gestation (p < .05) and reduced risk of preterm delivery (p < .01), whereas maternal perceived stress was not significantly associated with shorter length of gestation (p > .10). Conclusions: These findings suggest that maternal positive affect may be beneficial for outcomes related to the length gestation, and that this effect cannot be accounted for by the lower stress levels associated with higher positive affect.

Participants were asked to identify tone duration, while irrelevant changes occurred in tone frequency, tone intensity, and harmonic structure. Frequency deviants were randomly intermixed with standards (Uni-Condition), with intensity deviants (Bi-Condition), and with both intensity and complex deviants (Tri-Condition). Only in the Tri-Condition did the auditory distraction effect reflect the magnitude difference among the frequency and intensity deviants. The mixture of the different types of deviants in the Tr-Condition modulated the perceived level of distraction, demonstrating that the sound context can modulate the effect of deviance level on processing irrelevant acoustic changes in the environment. These findings thus indicate that perceptual contrast plays a role in change detection processes that leads to auditory distraction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we aimed at testing the hypothesis that anxiety disorders are associated with suicidal behaviors and evaluate the magnitude and quality of supporting evidence. MethodsA systematic literature search of multiple databases was conducted from database inception through August 2011. Two investigators independently reviewed and determined the eligibility and quality of the studies based upon a priori established inclusion criteria. The outcomes of interest were suicidal ideations, suicide attempts, completed suicides, and a composite outcome of any suicidal behaviors. We pooled odds ratios from the included studies using random effects models. ResultsForty-two observational studies were included. The studies had variable methodological quality due to inconsistent adjustment of confounders. Compared to those without anxiety, patients with anxiety were more likely to have suicidal ideations (OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 2.09, 4.00), attempted suicides (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.96, 3.10), completed suicides (OR = 3.34, 95% CI: 2.13, 5.25), or have any suicidal behaviors (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 2.35, 3.46). The increase in the risk of suicide was demonstrated for each subtype of anxiety except obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The quality of this evidence is considered low to moderate due to heterogeneity and methodological limitations. ConclusionsThis systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that the rates of suicides are higher in patients with any type of anxiety disorders excluding OCD.

We tested the hypothesis that PTSD resulting from assaultive trauma increases risk for attempted suicide among individuals with recurrent MDD. Methods Data on lifetime trauma exposures and clinical symptoms were collected using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies version 3.0 and best estimate diagnoses of MDD, PTSD, and other DSM-IV Axis I disorders were reported with best estimated age of onset. Results The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempt in this sample was 28%. Lifetime PTSD was diagnosed in 205 (14.3%) participants. We used discrete time-survival analyses to take into account timing in the PTSD-suicide attempt relationship while adjusting for demographic variables (gender, race, age, and education level) and comorbid diagnoses prior to trauma exposure. PTSD was an independent predictor of subsequent suicide attempt (HR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6, 3.8; P < .0001). Neither assaultive nor nonassaultive trauma without PTSD significantly predicted subsequent suicide attempt after Bonferroni correction. The association between PTSD and subsequent suicide attempt was driven by traumatic events involving assaultive violence (HR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.2; P< .0001). Conclusions Among those with recurrent MDD, PTSD appears to be a vulnerability marker of maladaptive responses to traumatic events and an independent risk factor for attempted suicide. Additional studies examining differences between those with and without PTSD on biological measures might shed light on this potential vulnerability.

The EEG measure of arousal response to errors was the degree of error-related alpha suppression (ERAS) in the intertrial interval, that is the reduction in alpha power following errors compared with correct responses. ERAS was relatively heightened at frontal sites for the HD versus the LD group, and frontal ERAS predicted lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and less adaptive coping behaviors in the daily reports.

This study examined how the experiences and perceived indicators of posttraumatic growth varied between American and Japanese men. Based on the posttraumatic growth (PTG) theoretical model, it was hypothesized that American men would report higher PTG than Japanese men, and PTG would vary by the type of event experienced. In addition, this study tested the hypothesis that some indicators of change would be rated as more representative of growth in American men than in Japanese men. American and Japanese men completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) based on their most stressful experience from the past five years and rated how each of the items in the PTGI was indicative of personal growth by using the modified PTGI. Results indicated that American men scored higher on the total PTGI and on three out of five domains of PTG. PTGI scores also varied by the type of event experienced. In the appreciation of life domain of the PTGI, for example, those who lost a loved one reported higher growth than those who experienced injury or severe illness and those who experienced financial or academic problems.

Although such retro-cuing has attracted considerable interest, the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that retro-cues might protect an item from degradation over time. We employed two techniques that previously have not been deployed in retro-cuing tasks. First, we used a sensitive, continuous scale for reporting the orientation of a memorized item, rather than binary measures (change or no change) typically used in previous studies. Second, to investigate the stability of memory across time, we also systematically varied the duration between the retro-cue and report. Although accuracy of reporting uncued objects rapidly declined over short intervals, retro-cued items were significantly more stable, showing negligible decline in accuracy across time and protection from forgetting. Retro-cuing an object's color was just as advantageous as spatial retro-cues. These findings demonstrate that during maintenance, even when items are no longer visible, attention resources can be selectively redeployed to protect the accuracy with which a cued item can be recalled over time, but with a corresponding cost in recall for uncued items.","2013-10","2018-12-21 18:12:16","2018-12-21 18:12:16","","1224-1231","","5","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attention; forgetting; memory decay; retro-cue; visual working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consistent with this possibility, in Study 1 individuals who chronically desired control reported less pain from a laboratory pain task when they were able to select between placebo analgesic treatments. Study 2 replicated this finding with an auditory discomfort paradigm. In Study 3, the desire for control was experimentally induced, and participants with high desire for control benefited more from a placebo treatment when they were able to choose their treatment. Study 4 revealed that the benefit of choice on treatment efficacy was partially mediated by thoughts of personal control.

This is surprising as cannabis can impair cognition in healthy subjects. An obvious question is whether the better current performance of psychotic patients who have used cannabis is a reflection of their having a higher premorbid IQ than those psychotic patients who haven't used cannabis. Aim: In a sample of patients at their first episode of psychosis, we tested the hypothesis that patients who smoked cannabis would have a higher premorbid IQ than patients who did not. Methodology: 279 participants (119 patients and 160 healthy controls) were assessed in order to obtain current and premorbid IQ measures and detailed information on cannabis use. We examined the association between cannabis use and both premorbid and current IQ in patients and controls. Results: Patients who had ever smoked cannabis had significantly higher current (p<.001) and premorbid IQ (p=.004) compared to patients who had never used cannabis. This difference was not found among controls. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the better cognitive performance of patients with their first episode of psychosis who have used cannabis compared with those who haven't is due to the better premorbid IQ of the former.

However, little is known about factors that may predict maternal depressive symptoms among low-income, African American maternal smokers-an understudied population with children known to have increased morbidity and mortality risks. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe)-related pediatric sick visits are associated with significant maternal depressive symptoms among low-income, African American maternal smokers in the context of other depression-related factors. Prior to randomization in a behavioral counseling trial to reduce child SHSe, 307 maternal smokers in Philadelphia completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) and questionnaires measuring stressful events, nicotine dependence, social support, child health and demographics. CES-D was dichotomized at the clinical cutoff to differentiate mothers with significant versus low depressive symptoms. Results from direct entry logistic regression demonstrated that maternal smokers reporting more than one SHSe-related sick visit (OR 1.38, p < .001), greater perceived life stress (OR 1.05, p < .001) and less social support (OR 0.82, p < .001) within the last 3 months were more likely to report significant depressive symptoms than mothers with fewer clinic visits, less stress, and greater social support. These results suggest opportunities for future hypothesis-driven evaluation, and exploration of intervention strategies in pediatric primary care. Maternal depression, smoking and child illness may present as a reciprocally-determined phenomenon that points to the potential utility of treating one chronic maternal condition to facilitate change in the other chronic condition, regardless of which primary presenting problem is addressed.

Guided by preclinical research and initial findings from a small-scale study involving humans, we tested the hypothesis that DCS enhancement of exposure therapy would be specific to successful exposure sessions. Method: Medication-free adults with generalized social anxiety disorder (N = 145) received 50 mg of DCS or placebo 1 h before each of 5 exposure sessions that were part of a standardized 12-session group CBT protocol. Participants provided fear ratings at the beginning and just before the end of exposure exercises. Independent raters, blind to group assignment, administered the clinical global impression improvement and severity scales at each session and at posttreatment. Results: Mixed-effects analyses revealed that, among patients who reported low fear at the end of an exposure session, those who had received DCS evidenced significantly greater clinical improvement at the next session, relative to those who had received placebo. In contrast, when exposure end fear was high, patients receiving DCS exhibited less clinical improvement at the following session than patients receiving placebo. Similarly, patients who had received DCS evidenced lower clinical severity at posttreatment, relative to patients who had received placebo, only when their average end fear for medication-augmented sessions had been in the low to moderate range. Finally, these moderating effects of exposure success as indexed by end fear were not better accounted for by within-session extinction. Conclusions: The efficacy of DCS for augmenting exposure-based CBT depends on the success of exposure sessions. These findings may help guide the development of an algorithm for the effective use of DCS for augmenting exposure-based CBT.

Methods: Eleven healthy adults and 8 depressed subjects performed the Emotional Counting Stroop task in alternating 15 second blocks of emotion words and neutral words while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocardiography (ECG). We measured the absolute value of change between adjacent 15 second blocks in both cardiac vagal control and the BOLD signal in specific regions of interest. Results: Strong positive correlations were observed in healthy control participants between changes in cardiac vagal control and changes in BOLD signal intensity in sgACC (BA25) (right: r=.67, p < .02; left r=.69, p < .02), as well as other key structures in the medial visceromotor network. Depressed subjects showed no significant correlations between cardiac vagal control and BOLD signal intensity within BA25 or any other brain region examined. During the transition from depression-specific emotion blocks to neutral blocks, the correlation between BOLD signal change in BA25 and cardiac vagal control change was significantly greater in controls than in depressed subjects (p < .04). Conclusions: Findings in healthy volunteers suggest that sgACC participates in affective state shifting. The latter function appears to be altered in depressed individuals, and may have implications for the unvarying mood and vagal dysfunction associated with depression.

Response conflict tasks produce sensitive measures of response interference from prepotent motor impulses and the proficiency of inhibiting these impulses as an act of cognitive control. We tested the hypothesis that individuals with Tourette syndrome show a deficit in inhibiting prepotent motor actions. Methods: Healthy controls and older adolescents/adults with persistent Tourette syndrome without a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and presenting with stable mood functioning (i.e., no history of well-treated anxiety or depression) participated in this study. They performed a Simon task that induced conflict between prepotent actions and goal-directed actions. A novel theoretical framework distinguished group differences in acting impulsively (i.e., fast motor errors) from the proficiency of inhibiting interference by prepotent actions (i.e., slope of interference reduction). Results: We included 27 controls and 28 individuals with Tourette syndrome in our study. Both groups showed similar susceptibility to making fast, impulsive motor errors (Tourette syndrome 26% v. control 23%; p = 0.10). The slope (m) reduction of the interference effect was significantly less pronounced among participants with Tourette syndrome than controls (Tourette syndrome: m = -0.07 v. control: m = -0.23; p = 0.022), consistent with deficient inhibitory control over prepotent actions in Tourette syndrome. Limitations: This study does not address directly the role of psychiatric comorbidities and medication effects on inhibitory control over impulsive actions in individuals with Tourette syndrome. Conclusion: The results offer empirical evidence for deficient inhibitory control over prepotent motor actions in individuals with persistent Tourette syndrome with minimal to absent psychiatric comorbidities. These findings also suggest that the frontal-basal ganglia circuits involved in suppressing unwanted motor actions may underlie deficient inhibitory control abilities in individuals with Tourette syndrome.","2013-09","2018-12-21 18:12:23","2018-12-21 18:12:23","","349-356","","5","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paradigm participants gave a fast, intuitive response, rated their feeling of rightness (FOR) for that response, and were then allowed free time to reconsider their answers. As we predicted, answers consistent with a matching heuristic (i.e., selecting cards named in the rule) were made more quickly than other answers, were given higher FOR ratings, and received less subsequent analysis as measured by rethinking time and the probability of changing answers.

However, the precise mechanisms of prediction are still poorly understood. Forward models, which draw upon the language production system to set up expectations during comprehension, provide a promising approach in this regard. Here, we present an event-related potential (ERP) study on German Sign Language (DGS) which tested the hypotheses of a forward model perspective on prediction. Sign languages involve relatively long transition phases between one sign and the next, which should be anticipated as part of a forward model-based prediction even though they are semantically empty. Native speakers of DGS watched videos of naturally signed DGS sentences which either ended with an expected or a (semantically) unexpected sign. Unexpected signs engendered a biphasic N400 late positivity pattern. Crucially, N400 onset preceded critical sign onset and was thus clearly elicited by properties of the transition phase. The comprehension system thereby clearly anticipated modality-specific information about the realization of the predicted semantic item. These results provide strong converging support for the application of forward models in language comprehension. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effects of isolated depletion of 5-HT in the LA, and the molecular mechanisms underlying enhanced glutamatergic activity are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that depletion of 5-HT in the LA induces increased fear behavior, and concomitantly enhances glutamate receptor (GluR) expression. Bilateral infusions of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (4 mu g per side) into the LA produced a regional reduction of serotonergic fibers, resulting in decreased 5-HT concentrations. The induction of low 5-HT in the LA elevated fear-potentiated startle, with a parallel increase in GluR1 mRNA and GluR1 protein expression. These findings suggest that low 5-HT concentrations in the LA may facilitate fear behavior through enhanced GluR-mediated mechanisms. Moreover, our data support a relationship between 5-HT and glutamate in psychopathologies.","2013-09","2018-12-21 18:12:25","2018-12-21 18:12:25","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","5; 5-HT; 7-DHT; anxiety; emotions; fear; GluR1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2013) tested the hypothesized dysgenic effect by subjecting to a meta-regression simple visual RT data collected over 100 years in 15 studies. This analysis found that RT had significantly increased according to a linear function over this time period. Woodley et al. then used this result to estimate the rate at which g had declined over the same period. The present comment points out that there are large gaps in the distribution of RTs analyzed by Woodley et al. with respect to year tested, and that RI in males did not vary as a function of year in the 13 studies published from 1941 on. It is concluded that although existing data are consistent with the idea that g has been adversely affected by dysgenic fertility, it cannot be determined at what rate g has fallen over time.

Self-to-standard discrepancy salience was manipulated by asking participants to list actual and ideal traits before versus after the lexical decision task. As predicted, mirror-exposed participants recognized suicide-related words quicker than those unexposed to their mirror image. Self-to-standard discrepancy salience did not moderate this effect.

We tested the hypothesis that one way of reducing responders' rejections of unfair offers is through increased psychological distance, so that participants move away from the concrete feeling of being unfairly treated. Social distance was manipulated by having participants play the Ultimatum Game either for themselves, or for another person.

Prior studies suggest that older persons exhibit lower literacy than younger persons, particularly in the domains of financial and health literacy, but the reasons why remain unknown. The objectives of this study were to: (a) examine pathways linking diverse resources (i.e., education, word knowledge, cognitive function, and decision making style) to health and financial literacy among older persons and determine the extent to which the relation of age with literacy represents a direct effect versus an indirect effect due to decrements in specific cognitive functions (i.e., executive functions and episodic memory); and (b) test the hypothesis that declines in executive function and episodic memory are associated with lower literacy among older persons without dementia. Six-hundred and forty-five community-based older persons without dementia underwent detailed assessments of diverse resources, including education, word knowledge, cognitive function (i.e., executive function, episodic memory) and decision making style (i.e., risk aversion), and completed a measure of literacy that included items similar to those used in the Health and Retirement Study, such as numeracy, financial concepts such as compound inflation and knowledge of stocks and bonds, and important health concepts such as understanding of drug risk and Medicare Part D. Path analysis revealed a strong effect of age on literacy, with about half of the effect of age on literacy due to decrements in executive functions and episodic memory. In addition, executive function had an indirect effect on literacy via decision making style (i.e., risk aversion), and education and word knowledge had independent effects on literacy. Finally, among (n = 447) persons with repeated cognitive assessments available for up to 14 years, regression analysis supported the association of multiple resources with literacy; moreover, more rapid declines in executive function and episodic memory over an average of 6.4 years prior to the literacy assessment predicted lower literacy scores (ps < 0.02), but rate of decline in word knowledge did not. These findings suggest that diverse individual resources contribute to financial and health literacy and lower literacy in old age is partially due to declines in executive function and episodic memory.","2013-09","2018-12-21 18:12:33","2018-12-21 18:12:33","","614-624","","3","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; cognitive decline; executive function; literacy; memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article we propose an integrative conceptualization of three important sources of reversed item method bias (acquiescence, careless responding, and confirmation bias) and specify a multisample confirmatory factor analysis model with 2 method factors to empirically test the hypothesized mechanisms, using explicit measures of acquiescence and carelessness and experimentally manipulated versions of a questionnaire that varies 3 item arrangements and the keying direction of the first item measuring the focal construct.

The addition of two methyl groups to the 9th lysine of histone 3 (H3K9me2) by histone methyltransferases (HMT) leads to a restrictive chromatin state, and thus reduced levels of gene transcription. Given the numerous reports of transcriptional down-regulation of candidate genes in schizophrenia, we tested the hypothesis that this illness can be characterized by a restrictive epigenome. Methods: We obtained parietal cortical samples from the Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium and lymphocyte samples from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). In both tissues we measured mRNA expression of HMTs GLP, SETDB1 and G9a via real-time RT-PCR and H3K9me2 levels via western blot. Clinical rating scales were obtained from the UIC cohort. Results: A diagnosis of schizophrenia is a significant predictor for increased GLP, SETDB1 mRNA expression and H3K9me2 levels in both postmortem brain and lymphocyte samples. G9a mRNA is significantly increased in the UIC lymphocyte samples as well. Increased HMT mRNA expression is associated with worsening of specific symptoms, longer durations of illness and a family history of schizophrenia. Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis of a restrictive epigenome in schizophrenia, and may associate with symptoms that are notoriously treatment resistant. The histone methyltransferases measured here are potential future therapeutic targets for small molecule pharmacology, and better patient prognosis.

How are they represented in this state? In 3 task-cuing experiments, we tested the hypothesis that phonological working memory is used to represent S-R rules for task-set control by getting participants to switch between 2 sets of arbitrary S-R rules and manipulating the articulatory duration (Experiment 1) or phonological similarity (Experiments 2 and 3) of the names of the stimulus terms. The task cue specified which of 2 objects (Experiment 1) or consonants (Experiment 2) in a display to identify with a key press. In Experiment 3, participants switched between identifying an object/consonant and its color/visual texture. After practice, neither the duration nor the similarity of the stimulus terms had detectable effects on overall performance, task-switch cost, or its reduction with preparation. Only in the initial single-task training blocks was phonological similarity a significant handicap. Hence, beyond a very transient role, there is no evidence that (declarative) phonological working memory makes a functional contribution to representing S-R rules for task-set control, arguably because once learned, they are represented in nonlinguistic procedural working memory.","2013-09","2018-12-21 18:12:35","2018-12-21 18:12:35","","1538-1551","","5","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","phonological coding; procedural working memory; S-R rules; task-cuing; task-switching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we sought to test the hypothesis that the positive relationship between spiritual experiences and life satisfaction is stronger among older African Americans than among older Whites. Method: The data came from 6864 community-dwelling persons aged 65+ (66% African American) who participated in the Chicago Health and Aging Project. Life satisfaction was measured using a five-item composite and we used a five-item version of the Daily Spiritual Experiences scale. Results: In a regression model adjusting for age, sex, marital status, education, income and worship attendance, we found that African American race was associated with lower life satisfaction. We also found a positive association between spiritual experiences and life satisfaction. In an additional model, a significant race by spiritual experiences interaction term indicates that spiritual experiences are more positively associated with life satisfaction among African Americans. Conclusion: The data suggest that at higher levels of spiritual experiences, racial differences in life satisfaction are virtually non-existent. However, at lower levels of spiritual experiences, older African Americans show modestly lower levels of life satisfaction than do older Whites. This pattern suggests that spiritual experiences are a positive resource - distinct from worship attendance - that enable older African Americans to overcome decrements in life satisfaction and, in fact, that lower spiritual experiences may be especially harmful for older African American's life satisfaction.","2013-09-01","2018-12-21 18:12:36","2018-12-21 18:12:36","","888-895","","7","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ethnicity; race; spirituality; well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One half of the participants was in a condition that mirrored a hot (standard) mood induction procedure and the other half was in a condition that mirrored the so-called cold-mood induction procedure, which involved a more descriptive focus on mood inducing stimuli, expected to reduce affect induction. We replicated the congruence effect between the mood inductions and the valence of the participants' recalled memories. Although participants in different conditions were exposed to the same semantic material, only hot mood induction congruently influenced autobiographical recall. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by mood, as measured by the self-report questionnaire.

Given the established role of HPA axis hormones in regulating bone metabolism, we tested the hypothesis that traumatic stress has a negative impact on bone development. We employed a variant single prolonged stress (SPS) model in which several stressors were applied to three week old C57BL/6J mice. Compared to the controls, the stressed mice showed increased freezing behavior reminiscent of PTSD symptoms. At two weeks, bone mineral content (BMC), bone area (B area) and bone mineral density (BMD) in total body based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) analysis were reduced by 10.2%, 7.0% and 3.6%, respectively. Micro-CT analysis of the metaphyseal region of the excised tibia revealed that SPS caused a deterioration of trabecular architecture with trabecular number (Tb.N), BV/TV, connectivity density (Conn-Den) decreasing 12.0%, 18.9%, 23.3% and trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp), structure model index (SMI) increasing 13.9%, 21.8%, respectively. Mechanical loading increased the cross-sectional area in the mid-shaft region of the loaded right versus unloaded left tibia by 7.6% in the controls, and 10.0% in the stressed mice. Therefore, SPS applied to pre-pubertal young mice produced strong negative impact on both bone mass acquisition and trabecular architecture.

Following a paranoia induction, 37 nonclinical participants were randomly assigned to either a rumination task or a distraction control condition. In accord with main hypothesis, rumination was associated with maintained levels of paranoia, whereas distraction was associated with a decrease in levels of paranoia. These findings suggest that perseverative thinking may play a role in the maintenance of paranoid ideas, which may have implications for our understanding of the maintenance of paranoia and persecutory delusions in the clinical population.

To improve understanding of the relationship between narcissism and SNS use, as well as the implications of differences in definition and measurement, we examine two ways of measuring Facebook and Twitter use by testing the hypothesis that SNS use is positively associated with narcissism. We also explore the relation between these types of SNS use and different components of narcissism within college students and general adult samples. Our findings suggest that for college students, posting on Twitter is associated with the Superiority component of narcissistic personality while Facebook posting is associated with the Exhibitionism component. Conversely, adults high in Superiority post on Facebook more rather than Twitter. For adults, Facebook and Twitter are both used more by those focused on their own appearances but not as a means of showing off, as is the case with college students. Given these differences, it is essential for future studies of SNS use and personality traits to distinguish between different types of SNS, different populations, and different types of use.

It is believed to start many years prior to symptoms and is reflected by reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the peptide A beta 1-42 (A beta 42). Here we tested the hypothesis that baseline levels of CSF proteins involved in microglia activity, synaptic function and A beta metabolism predict the development of A beta plaques, assessed by longitudinal CSF A beta 42 decrease in cognitively healthy people. Forty-six healthy people with three to four serial CSF samples were included (mean follow-up 3 years, range 2-4 years). There was an overall reduction in A beta 42 from a mean concentration of 211-195 pg ml(-1) after 4 years. Linear mixed-effects models using longitudinal A beta 42 as the response variable, and baseline proteins as explanatory variables (n = 69 proteins potentially relevant for A beta metabolism, microglia or synaptic/neuronal function), identified 10 proteins with significant effects on longitudinal A beta 42. The most significant proteins were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, P = 0.009), Chromogranin A (CgA, P = 0.009) and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL, P = 0.009). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis identified 11 proteins with significant effects on longitudinal A beta 42 (largely overlapping with the proteins identified by linear mixed-effects models). Several proteins (including ACE, CgA and AXL) were associated with A beta 42 reduction only in subjects with normal baseline A beta 42, and not in subjects with reduced baseline A beta 42. We conclude that baseline CSF proteins related to Ab metabolism, microglia activity or synapses predict longitudinal A beta 42 reduction in cognitively healthy elders. The finding that some proteins only predict A beta 42 reduction in subjects with normal baseline A beta 42 suggest that they predict future development of the brain Ab pathology at the earliest stages of AD, prior to widespread development of Ab plaques.","2013-08","2018-12-21 18:12:42","2018-12-21 18:12:42","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Alzheimer's disease; beta-amyloid; biomarker; cerebrospinal fluid; longitudinal; microglia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD) show cognitive deficits that are similar to but milder than those seen in SZ. Whether this similarity extends to the functioning of the semantic system. is unclear. To test the hypothesis that it does, we adapted a clustering technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) to investigate the clustering pattern of semantic retrieval in BD. Two category-fluency tasks (animal and supermarket-item naming) were administered to 98 adult outpatients with BD and 98 healthy adults (NC) who matched the BD group in age, sex, education, and estimated premorbid IQ. Results of clustering analysis showed that patients with BD produced less coherent category clusters than healthy adults. Specifically, patients with BD showed less coherent clusters of low-frequency animal names, but their overall productivity was not more impaired than the NCs'. In the supermarket condition, patients not only showed incoherent clustering of named supermarket items regardless of their frequencies, but also produced smaller numbers of exemplars than NCs did. The semantic system abnormalities shown by adults with BD were similar to those we found previously in persons with SZ, although the group differences were smaller. Overall, these results point to a concept retrieval/access deficit in BD and underscore the importance of analyzing the content of category-fluency productions.","2013-08","2018-12-21 18:12:43","2018-12-21 18:12:43","","624-634","","3","122","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; cluster analysis; cued word retrieval; semantic fluency; verbal fluency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that completing “body gestalts,” rather than being a purely visual process, is mediated by congruence in the postures of observer and stimulus. We developed novel stimuli showing a face and 2 hands that could be combined in various ways to form “body gestalts” implying different postures. In 3 experiments we found that imitative finger movements were consistently faster when the observer's posture matched the posture implied by the configuration of face and hands shown onscreen, suggesting that participants intuitively used their own body schema to “fill in the gaps” in the stimuli. Besides shaping how humans perceive others' bodies, embodied body-gestalt (eBG) completion may be an essential social and survival mechanism, for example, allowing for quick recovery from deceptive actions. It may also partly explain why humans subconsciously align themselves in everyday interactions: This might facilitate optimal corepresentation at higher, conscious levels.","2013-08","2018-12-21 18:12:47","2018-12-21 18:12:47","","774-790","","3","142","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","alignment; body schema; embodiment; posture/motor resonance; self-other mapping; social perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study we provide the first evidence that the search for explanatory coherence also plays a role in the memory errors that result from suggestive forensic interviews. Using a forced fabrication paradigm (e.g., Chrobak & Zaragoza, 2008), we conducted 3 experiments to test the hypothesis that false memory development is a function of the explanatory role these forced fabrications served (the explanatory role hypothesis). In support of this hypothesis, participants were more likely to subsequently freely report (Experiment 1) and falsely assent to (Experiment 2) their forced fabrications when they helped to provide a causal explanation for a witnessed outcome than when they did not serve this explanatory role. Participants were also less likely to report their forced fabrications when their explanatory strength had been reduced by the presence of an alternative explanation that could explain the same outcome as their fabrication (Experiment 3). These findings extend prior research on narrative and event comprehension processes by showing that the search for explanatory coherence can continue for weeks after the witnessed event is initially perceived, such that causally relevant misinformation from subsequent interviews is, over time, incorporated into memory for the earlier witnessed event.","2013-08","2018-12-21 18:12:48","2018-12-21 18:12:48","","827-844","","3","142","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","causal processing; eyewitness memory; false memory; source monitoring; text comprehension","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Across studies, higher social class rank was associated with increased essentialism of social class categories (Studies 1, 2, and 4) and decreased support for restorative justice (Study 4). Moreover, manipulated essentialist beliefs decreased preferences for restorative justice (Study 3), and the association between social class rank and class-based essentialist theories was explained by the tendency to endorse beliefs in a just world (Study 2).

In the present studies, we tested the hypothesis that imagined contact, that is, the mental representation of a positive intergroup encounter, improves intergroup relations for high RWAs. In two experimental studies, we showed that high RWAs, compared with low RWAs, show less negative emotions toward Turks (Study 1; N=120) and more willingness to engage in future contact with Romani people (Study 2; N=85) after imagined contact. As expected, people high in SDO did not benefit from imagined contact. Instead, people low in SDO showed less negative emotions after imagined contact in Study 1, but this effect was not replicated in the second study.

This study tested the hypothesis that peer relationships during adolescence predict life satisfaction during middle adulthood, using data from a 30-year prospective longitudinal study. Participants included 996 (49.5 % female) 8th grade students from a community sample of Swedish youth. Self-reports of friendship and peer reports of rejection were obtained when participants were age 15. Self-reports of global life satisfaction and perceived relationship quality were collected at age 43 for women and age 48 for men. Path analyses tested a direct-effects model that examined links from adolescent friendship participation and peer rejection to middle adulthood outcomes, and a buffered-effects model that examined links from adolescent peer rejection to middle adulthood outcomes, separately for those with and without friends during adolescence. Strong support emerged for the buffered-effects model but not the direct-effects model. Adolescent friendship participation moderated associations between adolescent peer rejection and adult global life satisfaction and between adolescent peer rejection and adult perceived relationship quality such that peer rejection predicted poorer adult outcomes for youth without friends but not for youth with friends. The findings suggest that the risks of peer rejection-and benefits of friendship-extend from adolescence well into middle age.","2013-08","2018-12-21 18:12:50","2018-12-21 18:12:50","","1299-1307","","8, SI","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Adolescent friendship; Adult life satisfaction; Friends; Peer rejection; Peers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-compassion, the ability to be kind to oneself, is an internal resource that may enhance a woman's ability to adjust to cancer-related bodily changes. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that self-compassion mediates the relationship between body image and distress, controlling for alternate plausible mediators. Methods Members of a nationwide breast cancer consumer network were invited to participate. A total of 279 women who had finished active cancer treatment completed the online survey. Assessments included the Body Image Scale; Self-compassion Scale; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and items measuring perceived normative pressure and comfort with one's weight. Possible mediating effects of proposed variables on the body image-distress relationship were assessed. Results Tests using a bootstrapping approach with multiple mediators were significant for self-compassion on distress. Body image disturbance was indirectly associated with distress through low self-compassion. Conclusions Body image disturbance and lower self-compassion were associated with increased psychological distress among these breast cancer survivors. This study provides preliminary evidence for a mediating role of self-compassion between body image disturbance and psychological distress, suggesting a potentially protective effect of higher levels of self-compassion for women at risk of experiencing body image disturbance.

Because the efficacy of interventions varies with the duration of pain, the identification of early biomarkers for chronic pain would have important public health consequences. Imaging of functional connectivity differences between brain regions might identify some of the earliest functional consequences of a disease process. We tested the hypothesis that chronic musculoskeletal pain in older persons is associated with changes in functional brain connectivity. Method We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and a spherical seed-based region of interest approach to assess functional connectivity of brain regions on a sample of 128 (64 who reported chronic musculoskeletal pain and 64 demographically matched, pain free) nondemented older adults from the Memory and Aging Project, a clinical-pathological cohort study of aging and dementia.

Stronger negative expectancies were associated with a decreased risk of initiation for family history positive but not family history negative participants. Conclusions: Findings are consistent with previous tobacco research indicating that FH + adolescents have more negative expectancies about cigarette smoking.

The activation of this androgen response is known to be mediated and moderated by psychological factors. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the testosterone (T) changes after a competition are not simply related to its outcome, but rather to the way the subject evaluates the event. In particular we tested two evaluative dimensions of a social interaction: familiarity with the opponent and the subjective evaluation of the outcome as threat or challenge. Challenge/threat occurs in goal relevant situations and represent different motivational states arising from the individuals' subjective evaluation of the interplay between the task demands and coping resources possessed. For challenge the coping resources exceed the task demands, while threat represents a state where coping resources are insufficient to meet the task demands. In this experiment women competed in pairs, against a same sex opponent using the number tracking test as a competitive task. Losers appraised the competition outcome as more threatening than winners, and displayed higher post-competition T levels than winners. No differences were found either for cortisol (C) or for dehydroepiandrosterone. Threat, familiarity with the opponent and T response were associated only in the loser condition. Moderation analysis suggests that for the women that lost the competition the effect of threat on T is moderated by familiarity with the opponent.","2013-07-05","2018-12-21 18:12:55","2018-12-21 18:12:55","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","challenge; cognitive appraisal; competition; familiarity; testosterone; threat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We implemented a multimethod approach and used ratings of opposite sex persons (Study 1), ratings of friends (Study 2), and records of courtship outcomes in naturalistic interactions (Study 3) as indicators of mate appeal. In all cases, narcissism had a positive effect on mate appeal, which was mainly due to the agentic self-enhancement aspects of narcissism (rather than narcissists' lacking communion). As predicted, physical attractiveness and social boldness mediated the positive effect of narcissism on mate appeal. Findings further indicated that narcissism was more strongly linked to mate appeal than to friend appeal.","2013-07","2018-12-21 18:12:56","2018-12-21 18:12:56","","870-882","","7","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attractiveness; boldness; mating; narcissism; popularity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort is a nationally representative longitudinal cohort study that followed children born in 2001 through kindergarten. This cross-sectional study examines the preschool wave (n = similar to 8950). We estimated nighttime sleep duration from parent's reports of their 4-year-old child's typical weekday bed and wake times. Parents rated their child on 6 different externalizing behaviors (overactivity, anger, aggression, impulsivity, tantrums, and annoying behaviors) on a scale from 1 through 5 using the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scale-second edition. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association between sleep duration and behavior scores and to control for possible confounders. Results: Results are weighted to total United States population,; 3,895,100 children born in 2001. Mean sleep duration was 10.47 hours. Mean bedtime was 8: 39 PM and wake time was 7: 13 AM. The adjusted odds ratios for children sleeping <9.44 hours (1 standard deviation below the mean) versus those sleeping >= 9.44 hours for 6 different externalizing behavior outcomes were as follows: overactivity = 1.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.65); anger = 1.40 (95% CI, 1.15-1.71); aggression = 1.81 (95% CI, 1.36-2.41); impulsivity 5 1.44 (95% CI, 1.12-1.86); tantrums = 1.46 (95% CI, 1.16-1.85); and annoying behaviors 5 1.40 (95% CI, 0.97-1.87).

In particular, we tested the hypothesis that the effects of beliefs about controllability on the willingness to provide personal help are mediated by the emotions of pity and anger, but that the effects of beliefs about controllability on the willingness to condone state-organised help were more direct, and not mediated by emotions. A between-groups design was employed to investigate the effects of manipulating controllability attributions via 3 hypothetical vignettes. ANOVA analysis of responses to a revised version of the AQ-27 from 371 participants demonstrated that beliefs about controllability lead to significantly higher personal responsibility beliefs, negative affective reactions and decreased helping intentions in comparison to when the cause of mental illness was believed to be uncontrollable. A mediation analysis demonstrated that pity and anger fully mediate the relationship between beliefs about controllability and the willingness to offer personal help, and also demonstrated that pity and anger partially mediate the relationship between beliefs about controllability and the willingness to condone help provided by the state. The partial mediation may indicate that the effects of beliefs about controllability on state-sponsored may be mediated by pity in some people, but that in other people, beliefs have a more proximal effect on behavior.

The identification of gestational influenza as a risk factor for BD may have potential for preventive approaches. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that maternal influenza during pregnancy is related to BD among offspring. DESIGN Nested case-control study of a population-based birth cohort from the Child Health and Development Study (CHDS). From January 1, 1959, through December 31, 1966, the CHDS recruited nearly all pregnant women receiving obstetric care from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan, Northern California Region (KPNC). Data on treated maternal influenza from the CHDS were used. Potential cases with BD from the cohort were identified by database linkages of identifiers among the CHDS, Kaiser Permanente database, and a large county health care database; by a mailed questionnaire to the CHDS cohort with subsequent interviews; and from an earlier psychiatric follow-up study on this birth cohort. SETTING The CHDS, Kaiser Permanente, and county health care databases. PARTICIPANTS Cases of BD (n = 92) confirmed by structured research interviews and consensus diagnosis among the 214 subjects (48% of those ascertained) who participated and control subjects (n = 722) matched on date of birth, sex, and membership in KPNC or residence in Alameda County.

The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that instability in feelings of depression, but not anxiety, guilt, or hostility, would predict greater concurrent and subsequent thoughts about self-injury. Thirty-six individuals with psychosis completed questions on touch-screen mobile phones at semi-random times each day for one week. The instability of depression predicted greater concurrent and subsequent levels of thoughts about self-injury, even when controlling for depression level. Conversely, self-injurious thoughts predicted more stable depression. The instability of guilt, anxiety, and hostility did not significantly predict levels of thoughts about self-injury. Results indicate that a variable depressive state may trigger the onset of thoughts about self-injury, which increases the risk of its subsequent recurrence. The onset of self-injurious thoughts may, however, have a stabilizing effect on subsequent depression.","2013-07-01","2018-12-21 18:13:00","2018-12-21 18:13:00","","275-287","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affect; emotions; mood; psychosis; schizophrenia; self-harm; suicide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective. - In the framework of vocational and gender stereotype theories, the objective was to test the hypothesis according to which boys would be more benevolent toward sex-typed vocational choices than non sex-typed ones, whereas the attitude of girls toward both vocational choices would be less determined by stereotypical prescriptions. Method. - In order to validate this prediction, 79 boys and 89 girls had to (a) assess more or less sex-typed occupational choices made by a fictitious boy or girl, (b) take a stand on the issue of gender equality, and (c) whatever their answer on the latter point, they had to justify their position in writing. Results. - The results on evaluative scales and discursive markers validated the general expectations. Indeed, boys were normative and supportive of gender inequality as they valued more traditional occupational choices than non-traditional ones. On the contrary, girls seemed to be more egalitarian than their male counterparts since they tended to enhance non sex-typed occupational choices. Discussion. - The discussion and the conclusion deal with gender role inequality, identity and identity-threat, as well as with reactance and risk-taking. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Exposure to negative ability stereotypes reliably undermines performance in laboratory experiments, yet the mechanisms by which such stereotypes may influence boys' and girls' achievement outcomes in the more naturalistic setting of primary and secondary school remain unclear. The current study evaluated a hypothesis suggested by expectancy-value theories (e.g., Eccles & Wigfleld, 2002): the relationship between stereotypes and achievement outcomes is importantly mediated by a student's perceived competence and his or her valuation of the domain in question. We tested the hypothesis by examining the career intentions and grades of 762 sixth and eighth graders. As expected, even after controlling for prior achievement, stereotype endorsement primarily predicted grades and career intentions indirectly, through students' competence beliefs and task values. These results suggest that stereotypes- predict achievement-related outcomes most clearly when students internalize them. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Little is known about the neural instantiations of spatial language. Using voxel-lesion symptom mapping (VLSM), we tested the hypothesis that focal brain injured patients who had damage to left frontal parietal peri-Sylvian regions would have difficulty in naming spatial relations between objects. We also investigated the relationship between impaired verbalization of spatial relations and spontaneous gesture production. Patients with left or right hemisphere damage and elderly control participants were asked to name static (e.g., an apple on a book) and dynamic (e.g., a pen moves over a box) locative relations depicted in brief video clips. The correct use of prepositions in each task and gestures that represent the spatial relations were coded. Damage to the left posterior middle frontal gyrus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left anterior superior temporal gyrus were related to impairment in naming spatial relations. Production of spatial gestures negatively correlated with naming accuracy, suggesting that gestures might help or compensate for difficulty with lexical access. Additional analyses suggested that left hemisphere patients who had damage to the left posterior middle frontal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus gestured less than expected, if gestures are used to compensate for impairments in retrieving prepositions.

Short German sentences consisting of a pronoun and a verb, either correct or containing a morphosyntactic violation, were auditorily presented to 17 German-speaking adults with dyslexia, and 17 matched control participants, while an EEG was recorded. In order to investigate the interaction between low-level phonological processing and morphosyntactic processing, the verbal inflections were manipulated to consist of different levels of acoustic salience. The event-related potential (ERP) results confirm altered morphosyntactic processing in participants with dyslexia, especially when morphosyntactic violations are expressed by both lexical and inflectional changes. Moreover, ERP data on phoneme discrimination and behavioural data on phonemic awareness and verbal short-term memory reveal phonological deficits in dyslexic participants. However, a causal relationship between phonological and morphosyntactic processing was not conclusive, because anomalous morphosyntactic processing in dyslexia is not directly mediated by acoustic salience, rather it correlates with high-level phonological skills and is mediated by lexical cues.

Prior research has suggested that young people in group settings have poorer criminal justice outcomes, perhaps attributable to negative peer effects in group environments. Aims To compare arrest rates during and after out-of-home treatment for youth across the three settings. To test the hypothesis that arrest rates during treatment are independently related to arrest rates after treatment, after allowing for pre-treatment characteristics and placement type. Methods Florida Medicaid claims data were used to identify children and adolescents in out-of-home mental health care from 2003-2007. These were then matched with Florida Department of Juvenile Justice and Law Enforcement records. Propensity score matching was used to allow for observed differences between youth in different treatment settings. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to test relationships between arrest rates. Results Unadjusted arrest rates for youth in therapeutic group home care were higher than in psychiatric inpatient units or foster care during and after treatment. Arrests during the treatment episode accounted for a substantial proportion of the difference in arrests after out-of-home treatment. After accounting for differences in arrest rates during treatment, the group versus non-group nature of the treatment setting per se was not a strong determinant of arrest after the treatment episode. Conclusions and implications for practise Attention to the causes of higher arrest rates in group homes, which may include peer contagion and staff policies, could improve outcomes. For youths without a major psychiatric disorder, therapeutic foster care may be better than community-based group care.

Aim This study aims to test the hypothesis that antisocial/borderline co-morbidity together with the triad of substance dependence, severe conduct disorder and borderline pathology would result in an increased risk of criminal recidivism. Methods Fifty-three men who had been assessed and treated in a secure hospital unit were followed up after they had returned to the community. They were assessed for severity of the following: (i) antisocial personality disorder; (ii) borderline personality disorder; (iii) drug/alcohol dependence; and (iv) high Psychopathy Checklist Revised scores (factors 1 and 2). Results Patients with antisocial/borderline co-morbidity took significantly less time to re-offend compared with those without such co-morbidity. Both Psychopathy Checklist Revised factor 2 and the tripartite risk measure significantly predicted time to re-offence; the former largely accounted for the predictive accuracy of the latter. Conclusion Risk of criminal recidivism can be adequately assessed without recourse to the pejorative term psychopath'. It is sufficient to assess the presence of the three elements of our risk measure: borderline and antisocial personality disorders in the context of drug/alcohol dependence and severe childhood conduct disorder. Practical implications of the study are as follows. (i) Sound assessment of personality, inclusive of a detailed history of childhood conduct disorder as well as adolescent and adult substance misuse, yields good enough information about risk of recidivism without recourse to the pejorative concept of psychopathy'. (ii) Given the high risk of alcohol-related violence in individuals with antisocial/borderline co-morbidity, there is a need for specific alcohol-directed interventions to help such men retain control of their substance use.

Two types of spiritual struggles have received considerable attention in this literature: divine struggles, or troubled relationships with God, and struggles with belief, or religious doubts. Using data from a nationwide online survey of U.S. adults conducted in 2006, our study investigated links between these types of spiritual struggles and four aspects of psychopathology: depressed affect, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and somatization. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that these links vary according to religious identity, such that individuals who identify themselves as highly religiousand therefore are likely to be most invested in their roles as religious personsexperience the strongest negative effects of spiritual struggles, in comparison with persons who identify themselves as moderately religious, or not religious at all. Findings supported this overall hypothesis.

In 2 eye-tracking-while-reading experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the difficulty associated with processing metonyms would depend on sentence structure. Experiment 1 examined comprehension of familiar place-for-institution metonyms (e.g., college) when they were an argument of the main verb and showed that they are more difficult to process in a figurative context (e.g., offended the college) than in a literal context (e.g., photographed the college). Experiment 2 demonstrated that when they are arguments of the main verb, familiar metonyms are more difficult to process than frequency-and-length-matched nouns that refer to people (e.g., offended the leader), but that this difficulty was reduced when the metonym appeared as part of an adjunct phrase (e.g., offended the honor of the college). The results support the view that figurative-language processing is moderated by sentence structure. When the metonym was an argument of the verb, the results were consistent with the pattern predicted by the indirect-access model of figurative-language comprehension.

In turn, these antecedent-focused regulation strategies were expected to help teachers deal with emotionally demanding situations at work. We tested the hypotheses using multiple mediation analyses of self-report data from 300 teachers, controlling for general perceived self-efficacy, teaching experience, work demands, and school-level effects. Results showed that both proactive coping and attending to student needs constituted mediators of the relations between self-emotion appraisal and burnout as well as between other-emotion appraisal and burnout.

The present investigation examines potential boundary conditions for interference, testing the hypothesis that potential competitors must be similar along task-relevant dimensions to influence proactive interference effects. We manipulated both the type of task being completed (Experiments 1, 2, and 3) and dimensions of similarity irrelevant to the current task (Experiments 4 and 5) to determine how the recent presentation of a probe item would affect the speed with which participants could reject that item. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 contrasted STM judgments, which require temporal information, with semantic and perceptual judgments, for which temporal information is irrelevant. In Experiments 4 and 5, task-irrelevant information (perceptual similarity) was manipulated within the recent probes task. We found that interference from past items affected STM task performance but did not affect performance in semantic or perceptual judgment tasks. Conversely, similarity along a nominally irrelevant perceptual dimension did not affect the magnitude of interference in STM tasks. Results are consistent with the view that items in STM are represented by noisy codes consisting of multiple dimensions and that interference occurs when items are similar to each other and, thus, compete along the dimensions relevant to target selection.","2013-07","2018-12-21 18:13:09","2018-12-21 18:13:09","","650-670","","5","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Inhibition in memory retrieval; Interference; Memory; Recognition; Short term memory; Working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we tracked observers' eye movements while they remembered a variable number of objects during change-detection tasks. We observed that during the blank retention interval, participants spontaneously shifted gaze to the locations that the objects had occupied in the memory array. Next, we hypothesized that if attention mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of object representations, then drawing attention away from the object locations during the retention interval should impair object memory during these change-detection tasks. Supporting this prediction, we found that attending to the fixation point in anticipation of a brief probe stimulus during the retention interval reduced change-detection accuracy, even on the trials in which no probe occurred.

The mechanisms that contribute to emotion dysregulation in anxiety disorders are not well understood. Two common disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD), were examined to test the hypothesis that both disorders are characterized by hypo-activation in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during emotion regulation. A competing hypothesis that GAD in particular is characterized by PFC hyper-activation during emotion regulation (reflecting overactive top-down control) was also evaluated. Method. Twenty-two medication-free healthy control (HC), 23 GAD, and 18 PD participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a task that required them to reappraise (i.e. reduce) or maintain emotional responses to negative images. Results. GAD participants reported the least reappraisal use in daily life, and reappraisal use was inversely associated with anxiety severity and functional impairment in these participants. During fMRI, HCs demonstrated greater activation during both reappraisal and maintenance than either GAD or PD participants (who did not differ) in brain areas important for emotion regulation (e. g. dorsolateral and dorsomedial PFC). Furthermore, across all anxious participants, activation during reappraisal in dorsolateral and dorsomedial PFC was inversely associated with anxiety severity and functional impairment. Conclusions. Emotion dysregulation in GAD and PD may be the consequence of PFC hypo-activation during emotion regulation, consistent with insufficient top-down control. The relationship between PFC hypo-activation and functional impairment suggests that the failure to engage PFC during emotion regulation may be part of the critical transition from dispositionally high anxiety to an anxiety disorder.","2013-07","2018-12-21 18:13:11","2018-12-21 18:13:11","","1475-1486","","7","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anxiety; emotion regulation; fMRI; generalized anxiety disorder; panic disorder; prefrontal cortex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three main hypotheses were tested: (1) individual level economic deprivation (i.e., ability to meet daily needs and family income) is associated with partner violence, (2) gross national income is associated with the mean rates of partner violence across nations, and (3) the association between individual level economic deprivation and partner violence varies according to the economic national context as measured by gross national income. Data for 14,090 participants from 31 nations came from the International Dating Violence Study that queried university students about violence in their relationships and relevant risk factors. A series of overdispersed Poisson hierarchical linear regression models were specified to test the hypotheses. Ability to meet daily needs, but not family income, was associated with rates of partner violence. Gross national income was also associated with mean rates of partner violence across nations as well as the relationships between ability to meet daily and partner violence and between family income and partner violence. The findings show the importance of context, as indicated by national economic standing, on rates of partner violence. Not only do economically deprived individuals experience more partner violence, but those living in poorer nations experience more partner violence, regardless of individual economic deprivation. Limitations of the study include a non-random sample and substantial variation in the study sites beyond economic standing. Nonetheless, findings indicate efforts to confront partner violence must also call for cross-national economic development. Aggr. Behav. 39:247-256, 2013.

The current study was designed to address three goals, (i) to provide evidence of a three-factor model of disinhibited personality (comprised of impulsivity [IMP], risk taking/low harm avoidance [RTHA], excitement seeking [ES]), (ii) to test hypotheses regarding the association between each dimension and alcohol use and problems, and (iii) to test the hypothesis that antisociality (social deviance proneness [SDP]) accounts for the direct association between IMP and alcohol problems, while ES is directly related to alcohol use. Measures of disinhibited personality IMP, RTHA, ES and SDP and alcohol use and problems were assessed in a sample of young adults (N = 474), which included a high proportion of individuals with AUDs. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor model of disinhibited personality reflecting IMP, RTHA, and ES. A structural equation model (SEM) showed that IMP was specifically associated with alcohol problems, while ES was specifically associated with alcohol use. In a second SEM, SDP accounted for the majority of the variance in alcohol problems associated with IMP. The results suggest that aspects of IMP associated with SDP represent a direct vulnerability to alcohol problems. In addition, the results suggest that ES reflects a specific vulnerability to excessive alcohol use, which is then associated with alcohol problems; while RTHA is not specifically associated with alcohol use or problems when controlling for IMP and ES.

In support of the hypotheses, a significant interaction was found between discrimination and national identity. In particular, perceived discrimination in the first year of college was positively associated with changes in ethnic identity commitment across the college years among participants with a weaker national identity, but negatively associated with changes in ethnic identity commitment among participants with a stronger national identity.

In earlier studies, we found different voice quality stimuli to be consistently associated with certain affective states. In these stimuli, as in typical human productions, the different voice qualities entailed differences in loudness. To examine the extent to which the loudness differences among these voice qualities might influence the affective coloring they impart, two experiments were conducted with the synthesized stimuli, in which loudness was systematically manipulated. Experiment 1 used stimuli with distinct voice quality features including intrinsic loudness variations and stimuli where voice quality (modal voice) was kept constant, but loudness was modified to match the non modal qualities. If loudness is the principal determinant in affect cueing for different voice qualities, there should be little or no difference in the responses to the two sets of stimuli. In Experiment 2, the stimuli included distinct voice quality features but all had equal loudness to test the hypothesis that equalizing the perceived loudness of different voice quality stimuli will have relatively little impact on affective ratings. The results suggest that loudness variation on its own is relatively ineffective whereas variation in voice quality is essential to the expression of affect. In Experiment 1, stimuli incorporating distinct voice quality features consistently obtained higher ratings than the modal voice stimuli with varied loudness. In Experiment 2, non-modal voice quality stimuli proved potent in affect cueing even with loudness differences equalized. Although loudness per se does not seem to be the major determinant of perceived affect, it can contribute positively to affect cueing: when combined with a tense or modal voice quality, increased loudness can enhance signaling of high activation states.","2013-06-18","2018-12-21 18:13:16","2018-12-21 18:13:16","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","affect; emotion; intensity; loudness; perception; voice quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods A cohort of 61 patients who met the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) following diagnosis using Axis I of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-text revision, and who had no history of hypomanic or manic episodes was included in this study. The patients were stratified into two subgroups based on whether or not they achieved a positive score for the Korean versions of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (K-MDQ). The LDAEP was evaluated by measuring the auditory event-related potentials before beginning medication with serotonergic agents. Results The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) score was also higher for the positive screening group (81.24 +/- 11.87) than for the negative screening group (73.30 +/- 14.92; p=0.039, independent t-test). However, the LDAEP, Beck Depression Inventory Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores did not differ significantly between them. When binary logistic regression analysis was carried, the relationship between the positive or negative subgroups for K-MDQ and BIS or Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS) score was also significant (respectively, p=0.017, p=0.038).

Friedman, 2006, On why the elderly have normal semantic retrieval but deficient episodic encoding: A study of left inferior frontal ERP activity, NeuroImage, Vol. 30, pp. 299-312) found that, compared with young adults, older adults show decreased event-related brain potential (ERP) activity over posterior left inferior prefrontal cortex (pLIPFC) in a 400- to 1,400-ms interval during episodic encoding. This altered brain activity was associated with significantly decreased recognition performance and reduced recollection-related brain activity at retrieval (D. Nessler, D. Friedman, R. Johnson, Jr., & M. Bersick, 2007, Does repetition engender the same retrieval processes in young and older adults? NeuroReport, Vol. 18, pp. 1837-1840). To test the hypothesis that older adults' well-documented episodic retrieval deficit is related to reduced pLIPFC activity at encoding, we used a novel divided attention task in healthy young adults that was specifically timed to disrupt encoding in either the 1st or 2nd half of a 300- to 1,400-ms interval. The results showed that diverting resources for 550 ms during either half of this interval reproduced the 4 characteristic aspects of the older participants' retrieval performance: normal semantic retrieval during encoding, reduced subsequent episodic recognition and recall, reduced recollection-related ERP activity, and the presence of “compensatory” brain activity. We conclude that part of older adults' episodic memory deficit is attributable to altered pLlPFC activity during encoding due to reduced levels of available processing resources. Moreover, the findings also provide insights into the nature and timing of the putative “compensatory” processes posited to be used by older adults in an attempt to compensate for age-related decline in cognitive function. These results support the scaffolding account of compensation, in which the recruitment of additional cognitive processes is an adaptive response across the life span.","2013-06","2018-12-21 18:13:19","2018-12-21 18:13:19","","443-456","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; divided attention; elaborative episodic encoding; episodic memory; event-related potentials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This cross-sectional study consisted of 2,055 pupils (995 boys and 1,060 girls) from 38 schools in Norway, with a mean age of 15.3 years. In addition to normal theory regression procedures, bootstrapping techniques were used to test the hypothesized indirect effect. Findings revealed that sport participation was inversely associated with loneliness mediated by perceived social competence. This indirect effect was evident when controlling for age, sex, non-organized physical activity and shyness. Findings suggest that sport participation during adolescence is indirectly associated with lower level of loneliness through higher level of perceived social competence. One may argue that sport participation during adolescence can contain important social components that help meet young peoples' social needs and expectations, which in turn may prevent feelings of loneliness.","2013-06","2018-12-21 18:13:20","2018-12-21 18:13:20","","203-216","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Loneliness; Non-organized physical activity; Perceived social competence; Shyness; Sport participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the warrant for subsequent growth interpretations depends upon the assumption that the scale has interval properties, the validation of a vertical scale would seem to require methods for distinguishing interval scales from ordinal scales. In taking up this issue, two different perspectives on educational measurement are contrasted: a metaphorical perspective and a classical perspective. Although the metaphorical perspective is more predominant, at present it provides no objective methods whereby the properties of a vertical scale can be validated. In contrast, when taking a classical perspective, the axioms of additive conjoint measurement can be used to test the hypothesis that the latent variable underlying a vertical scale is quantitative (supporting ratio or interval properties) rather than merely qualitative (supporting ordinal or nominal properties). The application of such an approach is illustrated with both a hypothetical example and by drawing upon recent research that has been conducted on the Lexile scale for reading comprehension.","2013","2018-12-21 18:13:21","2018-12-21 18:13:21","","204-226","","2","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we explored overlaps in cellular/molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral phenotypes between putative mouse models of bipolar disorder/schizophrenia and epilepsy. We tested the hypothesis that an immature dentate gyrus (iDG), whose association with psychosis in patients has recently been reported, represents a common phenotype of both diseases. Methods Behaviors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (-CaMKII) heterozygous knock-out (KO) mice, which are a representative bipolar disorder/schizophrenia model displaying iDG, and pilocarpine-treated mice, which are a representative epilepsy model, were tested followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)/immunohistochemistry for mRNA/protein expression associated with an iDG phenotype. In vitro electrophysiology of dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) was examined in pilocarpine-treated epileptic mice. Results The two disease models demonstrated similar behavioral deficits, such as hyperactivity, poor working memory performance, and social withdrawal. Significant reductions in mRNA expression and immunoreactivity of the mature neuronal marker calbindin and concomitant increases in mRNA expression and immunoreactivity of the immature neuronal marker calretinin represent iDG signatures that are present in both mice models. Electrophysiologically, we have confirmed that DG GCs from pilocarpine-treated mice represent an immature state. A significant decrease in hippocampal -CaMKII protein levels was also found in both models. Conclusions Our data have shown iDG signatures from mouse models of both bipolar disorder/schizophrenia and epilepsy. The evidence suggests that the iDG may, in part, be responsible for the abnormal behavioral phenotype, and that the underlying pathophysiologies in epilepsy and bipolar disorder/schizophrenia are strikingly similar.","2013-06","2018-12-21 18:13:21","2018-12-21 18:13:21","","405-421","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","bipolar disorder; calbindin; calcium; calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha; calretinin; dentate gyrus; doublecortin; neuronal immaturity; pilocarpine; schizophrenia; seizures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A multicenter, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel groups was performed from 2008 to 2012 in 4 hospitals in Sweden. Patients eligible had unipolar or bipolar depression and had responded to a course of ECT. The patients (n = 56) were randomly assigned (1: 1) to receiving either 29 treatments of continuation ECT with pharmacotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone for 1 year. The pharmacotherapy consisted of antidepressants (98%), lithium (56%), and antipsychotics (30%). The main outcome was relapse of depression within 1 year. Relapse was defined as 20 or more points on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale or inpatient psychiatric care or suicide or suspected suicide. All 56 patients randomized were analyzed according to an intention to treat analysis. Results: Sixty-one percent of the patients treated with pharmacotherapy versus 32% of the patients treated with ECT plus pharmacotherapy relapsed within 1 year (P = 0.036). The Cox proportional hazard ratio was 2.32 (1.03-5.22). Cognitive function and memory measures were stable for patients without relapse in both groups. One suspected suicide and 3 suicide attempts by intoxication occurred, all in the pharmacotherapy-alone group. Conclusions: The post-ECT relapse rates were substantial in both treatment groups with a statistically significant advantage for combined treatment with pharmacotherapy and continuation ECT.

Mediated models have been proposed to account for the relationships among academic emotions, cognitive/motivational variables, and achievement, and research has supported such mediated models, particularly with negative emotions. Aims.The study tested the hypotheses: (1) self-regulation and the positive academic emotions of enjoyment and pride are positive predictors of achievement; and (2) enjoyment and pride both moderate the relationship between self-regulation and achievement. Sample.Participants were 1,345 students enrolled in various trigonometry classes in one university. Methods.Participants answered the Academic Emotions Questionnaire-Math (Pekrun, Goetz, & Frenzel, 2005) and a self-regulation scale (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, & McKeachie, 1991) halfway through their trigonometry class. The students' final grades in the course were regressed to self-regulation, positive emotions, and the interaction terms to test the moderation effects. Results and Conclusions.Enjoyment and pride were both positive predictors of grades; more importantly, both moderated the relationship between self-regulation and grades. For students who report higher levels of both positive emotions, self-regulation was positively associated with grades. However, for those who report lower levels of pride, self-regulation was not related to grades; and, for those who reported lower levels of enjoyment, self-regulation was negatively related to grades. The results are discussed in terms of how positive emotions indicate positive appraisals of task/outcome value, and thus enhance the positive links between cognitive/motivational variables and learning.","2013-06","2018-12-21 18:13:25","2018-12-21 18:13:25","","329-340","","2","83","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests the hypothesis that patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have abnormal white matter microstructure in the amygdala and ACC, as inferred from diffusion tensor imaging, compared with healthy controls. Methods: Subjects were 16 right-handed, first-episode, treatment-naive GAD patients without comorbid disorders and 26 matched, healthy comparison controls. All subjects underwent diffusion tensor imaging and structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scanning. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a robust intravoxel measure of water self-diffusion, was compared between groups on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Associations between clinical ratings of symptom severity (i.e., the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and FA were assessed. Results: Compared with healthy volunteers, patients demonstrated significantly higher FA in the right amygdala white matter and lower FA in the caudal ACC/mid-cingulate cortex white matter. Higher right amygdala FA correlated significantly with higher Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores and higher Penn State Worry Questionnaire scores. Limitations: The sample size was modest and may contribute to false positive effects. Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence of an abnormality in white matter microstructure that involves the amygdala and the cingulate cortex in the pathogenesis of GAD, and are consistent with neurobiological models that posit a defect in emotion-related brain regions.

Methods: We coded family interactions at age 1213 and friendship interaction at age 1617 in a multiethnic sample of youth and families. Violence in young adulthood (age 2223) was measured using self-report, criminal records, and parent report. We tested the hypothesis that a process of coercive joining' in friendship interactions mediated the relationship between coercive family interactions and serious violence. Results: We found that observed coercive joining in friendships at age 1617 predicted early-adulthood violent behavior over and above an established tendency toward antisocial behavior. We also found that observed coercive family interactions at age 12 predicted early-adulthood violence, and that coercive joining with friends fully mediated this link. Conclusions: These results significantly extend coercion theory by suggesting that coercive joining in the context of peer groups is an additional mechanism by which coercive processes in the family are extended and amplified to violent behavior in early adulthood. Our findings suggest the importance of addressing both individual interpersonal skills and self-organizing peer groups when intervening to prevent violent behavior.","2013-06","2018-12-21 18:13:27","2018-12-21 18:13:27","","661-669","","6","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescence; Coercion theory; family processes; peer processes; violent behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-identity, an important self-regulatory and resource-related variable, was proposed to moderate the unfairness-CWB relations. A sample of 361 Chinese airline industry employees completed measures of identity, interpersonal unfairness, and CWB directed at people or the organization. We conducted a series of moderated regression analyses to test the hypotheses. We found as expected relational identity (identity based on dyadic connection to another person) and collective identity (identity based on membership in a social group) buffered unfairness-CWB relations, such that positive relations were weaker when relational or collective identity was high (vs. low). Support was not found for the proposed moderation effect of individual identity (identity based on uniqueness from others) on unfairness-CWB relations. Supplementary relative weight analyses indicated that multiple identity levels and interactions between them accounted for considerable proportions of explained variance in CWB. These findings suggest that different levels of employee identity seem to play different roles in the interpersonal unfairness-CWB relations, and it is important to continue studying employee identity profiles in the context of predicting CWB occurrences. This study not only advances our understanding of potential antecedents of CWB, but also underscores the importance of simultaneously studying all three levels of employee identity.","2013-06","2018-12-21 18:13:29","2018-12-21 18:13:29","","189-202","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Counterproductive work behavior; Identity; Moderation; Self; Unfairness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods.Attachment styles were identified using the Relationship Questionnaire (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991) among 100 outpatients with an ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnosis. Current symptom severity was measured by the Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (Kay, Fiszbein, & Opler, 1987) and emotional distress by the General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg & Williams, 1988). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test the hypotheses. Results.The preoccupied and fearful-avoidant attachment patterns were associated with higher scores of psychotic (delusions, suspiciousness/persecution, and hallucinatory behaviour) and affective (anxiety, tension, guilt feeling, and depression) symptoms, whereas the dismissing-avoidant style was associated with only anxiety. All the insecure attachment styles were associated with elevated emotional distress. Conclusions.The findings support the hypothesis of a predisposing role of the preoccupied and fearful-avoidant styles in psychotic symptom formation and call for cognitive interpersonal interventions geared to reduce symptom and emotional distress severity.

A number of brain alterations have been linked to cognitive impairment, including neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, increased arachidonic acid (AA) signaling and reduced synaptic protein. On this basis, we tested the hypothesis that SZ pathology is associated with these pathological brain changes. To do this, we examined postmortem frontal cortex from 10 SZ patients and 10 controls and measured protein and mRNA levels of cytokines, and astroglial, microglial, neuroinflammatory, excitotoxic, AA cascade, apoptotic and synaptic markers. Mean protein and mRNA levels of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP), a microglial marker CD11b, and nuclear factor kappa B subunits were significantly increased in SZ compared with control brain. Protein and mRNA levels of cytosolic and secretory phospholipase A(2) and cyclooxygenase also were significantly elevated. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits 1 and 2B, inducible nitric oxide synthase and c-Fos were not significantly different. In addition, reduced protein and mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, synaptophysin and drebrin were found in SZ compared with control frontal cortex. Increased neuroinflammation and AA cascade enzyme markers with synaptic protein loss could promote disease progression and cognitive defects in SZ patients. Drugs that downregulate these changes might be considered for new therapies in SZ.

Negative symptoms play a prominent role in the impaired functioning of individuals with schizophrenia and those at clinical-high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. Despite high rates of depression and anxiety in early psychosis, few studies have examined the contribution of these symptoms to functioning in the putative `prodrome.' In the current study, we tested the hypotheses that 1) worse negative and disorganized, but not positive, symptoms would be significantly related to impaired social and role functioning in two cohorts of CHR individuals (combined N = 98) and a separate sample of individuals with recent-onset (RO) psychotic disorders (N = 88); and 2) worse anxiety and depression would be significantly related to impaired functioning in both samples, above and beyond the contributions of negative and disorganized symptoms. Findings largely supported our hypotheses that more severe negative and disorganized symptoms were related to poorer social and role functioning in both samples. Anxiety and depression severity were significantly related to poorer functioning in both samples. In addition, depression, but not anxiety, predicted poorer global and social functioning above and beyond that explained by negative symptoms in the CHR sample. These results suggest the need for phase-specific treatment in early psychosis, with a focus on symptom dimensions to improve functional outcomes for CHR individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Compared to baseline heat pain ratings, concurrent foot immersion lowered pain intensity ratings, which suggests an inhibitory effect, was reduced with naltrexone, suggesting at least partial dependence of inhibition on endogenous opioids. An exploratory analysis revealed that individual differences in catastrophizing moderated the effects of naltrexone; endogenous opioid blockade abolished modulation in subjects lower in catastrophizing while modulation was unaffected by naltrexone among high catastrophizers.

Method: Seventy-one members of a rehabilitation program (age 23 to 69; M = 49) were asked to rate satisfaction with their own recovery and with their current mental and physical health. The study hypothesis was tested in two hierarchical regression analyses that examined variation in the correlation between mental health and recovery self-ratings first by age and then by year of first hospitalization. Results: The correspondence between mental health and recovery self-ratings was twice as strong for adults age 50 and older compared with those younger than age 50 and this same age difference in self-ratings was also evident for participants first hospitalized for a psychiatric illness earlier versus later than 1990. The correlation between physical health and recovery self-ratings did not vary by age or year of first hospitalization.

The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis of partial common genetic background of both disease, AN and OCD. A total of 116 patients with AN, 74 patients with OCD and 91 controls participated in this study. 213 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 28 candidate genes were analyzed. Five SNPs achieved 0.004 (the nominal p-value expected by chance), 3 with empirical significant p-values (rs10070190 (CDH9) p = 1 x 10(-3), rs4825476 (GRIA3)p = 4 x 10(-4), and rs1074815 (TPH2) p = 8 x 10(-4)) and 2 additional polymorphisms showing nominal significance (rs2834070 (OLIG2) p = 2 x 10(-3) and rs11783752 (SCL18A1) p = 3 x 10-3), were found to be related to both AN and OCD. In addition, rs3825885 (NTRK3, p = 9 x 10-4) was identified as an AN risk variant, and rs11179027 (TPH2, p = 2 x 10-3) as an OCD marker. The ROC analysis confirmed these results and showed interaction among the significant SNPs. The preliminary results we report here reveal a partial common genetic background in AN and OCD, in agreement with previous clinical findings of common symptomathology between these two diseases and open the field of possible treatments for AN. The interaction observed between the associated polymorphisms, could indicate that there is a biological interaction between the serotonin (TPH2 and SLC18A1) and glutamate (GRIA3) pathways and the factors related to neurogenesis (CDH9, OLIG2 and NTRK3) for the explanation of etiopathophysiology in both diseases. However, the results must be replicated in studies with larger cohorts in order to confirm these associations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The early postpartum period is characterized by a downward physiological shift from relatively elevated levels of sex steroids during pregnancy to diminished levels after parturition. Sex steroids influence functional brain connectivity in healthy non-puerperal subjects. This study tests the hypothesis that PPD is associated with attenuation of restingstate functional connectivity (rs-fc) within corticolimbic regions implicated in depression and alterations in neuroactive steroid concentrations as compared to healthy postpartum women. Subjects (n = 32) were prospectively evaluated during pregnancy and in the postpartum with repeated plasma neuroactive steroid measurements and mood and psychosocial assessments. Healthy comparison subjects (HCS) and medication-free subjects with unipolar PPD (PPD) were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) within 9 weeks of delivery. We performed rs-fc analysis with seeds placed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and bilateral amygdala (AMYG), hippocampi (HIPP) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFCs). Postpartum rs-fc and perinatal neuroactive steroid plasma concentrations, quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, were compared between groups. PPD subjects showed attenuation of connectivity for each of the tested regions (i.e. ACC, AMYG, HIPP and DLPFC) and between corticocortical and corticolimbic regions vs. HCS. Perinatal concentrations of pregnanolone, allopregnanolone and pregnenolone were not different between groups. This is the first report of a disruption in the rs-fc patterns in medication-free subjects with PPD. This disruption may contribute to the development of PPD, at a time of falling neuroactive steroid concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Unconscious Thought Theory predicts that information can be conceptually organized after a period of unconscious thought (UT), more so than after conscious thought (CT). We aimed to test the hypothesis that UT decreases intrusions and increases conceptual organization in memory. Methods: Participants were shown a stressful film and were required to perform an UT task, a CT task, or a distraction task. Intrusions of the film, intrusion qualities, and sequence memory were measured afterwards. Results: We confirmed our hypothesis that UT (versus CT or mere distraction) leads to fewer intrusions, thereby replicating earlier research. Contrary to prediction, we found no difference between the conditions on sequence memory. In addition, conscious thought appeared to increase intrusion nowness and arousal. Limitations: The analogue design and healthy participant sample prevent from generalizing results to other populations. Intrusion frequency and qualities were assessed immediately after the film thereby prohibiting us from drawing conclusions about any long-term effects. Conclusions: Engaging in unconscious thought after a stressful film can reduce intrusion frequency. This has potential implications for clinical interventions to prevent initial stress symptoms. The underlying mechanism remains unclear, for now and provides an avenue for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, the Mood-as-Input model (MAI) proposes that the interaction between goals and moods affects performance duration. When people adopt achievement goals, negative, as opposed to positive moods, signal that not enough progress has been made leading to task continuance. Negative as opposed to positive moods lead to task disengagement when adopting hedonic goals. Methods: Participants completed three open-ended cognitive tasks while being exposed to mechanical pressure pain to a finger. Before each task, mood (positive versus negative) and goal pursuit (hedonic versus achievement) were manipulated, with mood as between-subjects and goal pursuit as within-subjects factor. Performance duration was the dependent variable and goal order and performance duration during a no-goal task were the covariates. Result: In line with common theories on goals and mood, but in contrast to the MAI model, only main effects were found of mood and goal pursuit. Participants showed greater Performance duration in an achievement than in a hedonic goal context. Moreover, they showed greater performance duration in relative positive than negative moods. Limitations: Pain may have decreased participants' mood below a certain threshold, which in turn may have obscured the MAI interaction effect. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that affective and motivational factors influence performance duration in a pain context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Mathematics achievement scores at the end of 1 year of preschool indicated that 34 of these children were at high risk for MLD. Relative to the 34 typically achieving children, the at risk children were less accurate on the ANS task, and a one standard deviation deficit on this task resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in the odds of MLD status. The at risk children also had a poor understanding of ordinal relations, and had slower learning of Arabic numerals, number words, and their cardinal values. Poor performance on these tasks resulted in 3.6- to 4.5-fold increases in the odds of MLD status.

Here we report findings from a laboratory experiment, replicated in two countries (Israel and the United States), testing the hypotheses that (a) increased security (accomplished through subliminal priming) fosters caregiving behavior toward a romantic partner who discloses a personal problem, and (b) this increased security overcomes barriers to responsiveness induced by mental depletion. We gathered data on participants' attachment insecurities, randomly assigned them to one of four mental depletion (yes, no) and priming (security, neutral) conditions, and coded their behavior in an interaction with their romantic partner who was disclosing a personal problem. Dispositional attachment insecurities and manipulated mental depletion adversely affected caregiving, but security priming overrode the detrimental effects of both mental depletion and attachment insecurity in both Israel and the United States.","2013-05-01","2018-12-21 18:13:40","2018-12-21 18:13:40","","246-260","","3, SI","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","attachment style; caregiving; couples; depletion; security priming; social support","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meta-Analysis of the Crossed Therapist Design in Comparative Psychotherapy Trials","JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY","","0160-6689","10.4088/JCP.12r07848","","Objective: Clinical trials sometimes have the same therapists deliver more than 1 psychotherapy, ostensibly to control for therapist effects. This “crossed therapist” design makes controlling for therapist allegiance imperative, as therapists may prefer one treatment they deliver to the other(s). Research has established a strong relationship between principal investigators' allegiances and treatment outcome. Study therapists' allegiances probably also influence outcome, yet this moderating factor on outcome has never been studied. Data Sources: English language abstracts in PsycINFO and MEDLINE from January 1985 to December 2011 were searched for keywords psychotherapy and randomized trial. Study Selection:The search yielded 990 abstracts that were searched manually. Trials using the same therapists in more than 1 condition were included. Data Extraction: Thirty-nine studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Meta-regression analyses assessed the influence of researchers' allegiance on treatment outcome, testing the hypothesis that studies poorly controlling for therapist allegiance would show stronger influence of researcher allegiance on outcome. A single-item measure assessed researchers' reported attempts to control for therapist allegiance. Results: Only 1 of 39 studies (3%) measured therapist treatment allegiance. Another 5 (13%) mentioned controlling for, without formally assessing, therapist allegiance. Most publications (67%) did not even mention therapist allegiance. In studies not controlling for therapist allegiance, researcher allegiance strongly influenced outcome, whereas studies reporting control for therapist allegiance showed no differential researcher allegiance. Researchers with cognitive-behavioral therapy allegiance described controlling for therapist allegiance less frequently than other researchers. Conclusions: The crossed therapist design is subject to bias due to differential psychotherapist allegiance. Worrisome results suggest that researchers strongly allied to a treatment may ignore therapist allegiance, potentially skewing outcomes. All clinical trials, and especially crossed therapist designs, should measure psychotherapist allegiance to evaluate this possible bias.","2013-05","2018-12-21 18:13:41","2018-12-21 18:13:41","","482-491","","5","74","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, multiple instances of victimization by different perpetrators, defined here as revictimization, may lead to different psychological consequences than repeated victimization by the same perpetrator, defined here as chronic victimization. In the current study, we examined associations between individual PTSD symptoms and revictimization and chronic victimization in a sample of 236 ethnically diverse women recruited following exposure to police reported IPV. When looking at individual symptoms, revictimization (and not chronic victimization) predicted symptoms associated with “passive” avoidance or emotional numbing, whereas chronic victimization (and not revictimization) predicted symptoms associated with “active” avoidance.

Recent calls to assist decision makers in mitigating these biases-via interventions commonly called “nudges”- have been criticized as infringing upon individual autonomy. We tested the hypothesis that such “decisional enhancement” programs that target overt decision making-i.e., conscious, higher-order cognitive processes-would be more acceptable than similar programs that affect covert decision making i.e., subconscious, lower-order processes. We presented respondents with vignettes in which they chose between an option that included a decisional enhancement program and a neutral option. In order to assess preferences for overt or covert decisional enhancement, we used the contrastive vignette technique in which different groups of respondents were presented with one of a pair of vignettes that targeted either conscious or subconscious processes. Other than the nature of the decisional enhancement, the vignettes were identical, allowing us to isolate the influence of the type of decisional enhancement on preferences. Overall, we found support for the hypothesis that people prefer conscious decisional enhancement. Further, respondents who perceived the influence of the program as more conscious than subconscious reported that their decisions under the program would be more “authentic”. However, this relative favorability was somewhat contingent upon context.

Previous studies have documented limitations in young children's ability to reject misleading advice. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that these limitations are primarily due to an inability to reject specific directions that are provided by others, rather than an inability to respond in a way that is opposite to what has been indicated by a cue. In Studies 1 through 4, a puppet identified as The Big Bad Wolf offered advice to participants about which of two boxes contained a hidden sticker. Regardless of the form the advice took, 3-year olds performed poorly by failing to systematically reject it. However, when participants in Study 5 believed they were responding to a mechanical cue rather than the advice of the Wolf, they were better able to reject misleading advice, and individual differences in performance on the primary task were systematically correlated with measures of executive function. Results are interpreted as providing support for the communicative intent hypothesis, which posits that children find it especially difficult to reject deceptive information that they perceive as being intentionally communicated by others.","2013-06","2018-12-21 18:13:44","2018-12-21 18:13:44","","646-667","","4","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive development; Deception; Early-childhood development; Informants; Interpersonal communication; Social cognition; Trust (social behavior)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV-TR) establishes the most commonly accepted criteria for diagnosis (Inattentive: ADHD-I, Hyperactive/impulsive: ADHD-HI, and Combined: ADHD-C), but currently, diverse studies disagree about whether to address it as a continuum with different degrees of intensity (subtype structure) or as specific disorders (counterposed profiles). Prior research has tested the hypothesis of differential categories with performance measures and cortical activation. The goal proposed herein is to confirm these results, incorporating a new measure, near-infrared hemoencefalography (nir-HEG), in order to control cortical activation through levels of blood oxygenation. For this purpose, we used a sample of 205 children between 8 and 13 years (105 control group, 28 with ADHD-I, 35 with ADHD-HI, and 37 with ADHD-C), administering a continuous performance test (TOVA), quantified electroencephalogram (Q-EEG), and nir-HEG. Results reflect the counterposed profiles hypothesis instead of the degrees of intensity, although the latter is more habitual and generalized. (C) 2012 Asociacion Espanola de Psicologia Conductual.

The social-cognitive process of transference is a mechanism by which past relationships emerge in the present, i.e., through the relatively automatic use of significant-other (SO) representations in judging and remembering others. Two experiments tested the hypothesis that this process can be strategically regulated by the use of implementation intentions, which can automatize desired goal pursuit. Participants motivated to prevent transference learned about three individuals, one subtly resembling their own SO, and were provided either with no-additional strategy or with a goal intention to prevent transference, or crucially, with an implementation intention to prevent it Across both experiments, the evidence strongly supported our hypothesis. Response latencies in a primed lexical derision task showed that, regardless of strategy, the SO representation was activated with the relevant new person, and yet, in terms of recognition memory, only those participants in the no-additional strategy and the goal-intention conditions showed the transference effect-i.e., the application of the knowledge that was activated by SO-resemblance. As predicted, those randomly assigned to the implementation-intention condition did not. In short, participants in the implementation-intention condition effectively prevented transference. The experiments provide the first evidence we know of that individuals can be trained to use a regulation strategy with which to effectively regulate transference, when needed, using a strategy that itself can be relatively automatic.

Clinical responses to antidepressants among 1036 acutely depressed patients with bipolar or unipolar major affective disorders. Objective Whether responses to antidepressants differ in bipolar and unipolar depression remains unresolved. Method We analyzed patient characteristics and outcomes of antidepressant treatment of 1036 depressed patients with bipolar-I or bipolar-II disorder, or unipolar major depression, using bivariate and multivariate methods and survival analysis, testing the hypothesis that responses would be superior in unipolar depression. Results Antidepressants were given to 84.8% (878/1036) of depressed patients: 58.9% of 93 bipolar-I, 80.1% of 117 bipolar-II, and 91.3% of 668 unipolar disorder cases. The 158 not given antidepressants had more manias/year, spent more months in mania and depression, and were far more likely to receive mood stabilizers or antipsychotics long term. Improvement of HDRS21 depression ratings ranked: bipolar-II (69.6%)>bipolar-I (62.9%)>unipolar (57.9%; P<0.0001), independent of initial illness severity. Responder rates (50% improved without switching) ranked: bipolar-II (77.0%)>bipolar-I (71.6%)>unipolar (61.7%; P<0.0001). Remission rates (final HDRS<7) ranked: 54.0%, 50.6%, and 40.8% respectively (P=0.02); 67.5% remitted within 12weeks of treatment. Survival-computed median time to remission (15.0weeks, overall) was shortest for bipolar-II patients (10.7weeks). The 3-month risk of switching into maniahypomania ranked: bipolar-II (15.8%)>bipolar-I (8.60%)>unipolar (0.56%). Multivariate modeling found bipolar diagnosis, shorter latency to remission, more recent trial year, and fewer weeks depressed before treatment to be associated with greater percent improvement of HDRS ratings. Conclusion Selective use of antidepressants with or without mood stabilizers in non-agitated, depressed bipolar disorder patients for short periods was effective with moderate risk of potentially dangerous, manic mood elevation.","2013-05","2018-12-21 18:13:46","2018-12-21 18:13:46","","355-364","","5","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","antidepressant response; bipolar disorder; depression; major depressive disorder; switching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been shown that weakening such belief- e.g. by exposure to `antifree will' messages - can lead people to display antisocial tendencies. We propose that this cursory and irresponsible behavior may be facilitated by a breakdown of neurocognitive mechanisms underlying behavioral adjustments. In the study reported here, we tested the hypothesis that weakening belief in intentional control reduces cognitive markers of behavioral control. Participants performed a Simon task before and after reading a scientific text either denying free will (no-free will group) or not mentioning free will (control group). Results showed that the post-error slowing, a cognitive marker of performance adjustment, was reduced in the no-free will group. This reduction was proportional to a decrease of the belief in intentional control. These observations indicate that weakening the belief in free will can impact behavioral adjustment after an error, and could be the cause of antisocial and irresponsible behavior.

Drawing on theory of the mechanisms of change in cognitive-reminiscence therapy, the current study tests the hypothesised indirect associations of adaptive integrative and instrumental reminiscence functions with depressive symptoms and whether these relationships might differ among younger and older adults. Questionnaires were completed by a large community sample of the Australian population. Multiple mediation models were tested in two groups: younger adults (n = 730, M age = 52.24, SD=9.84) and older adults (n = 725, M age= 73.59, SD=6.29). Results were consistent across age groups, indicating that there was direct relationship between these reminiscence functions and depressive symptoms, but that integrative reminiscence is indirectly associated with depressive symptoms through meaning in life, self-esteem, and optimism, and that instrumental reminiscence is indirectly associated with depressive symptoms through primary control and self-efficacy. This study provides support for the relationships between constructs underlying the proposed mechanisms of change in cognitive-reminiscence therapy for the treatment of depression, and suggests these relationships are similar for younger and older adults.","2013-05-01","2018-12-21 18:13:48","2018-12-21 18:13:48","","444-457","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Depression; Meaning; Memory; Optimism; Perceived control; Reminiscence; Self-efficacy; Self-esteem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods This study used the data from 1572 older people obtained from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey in Taiwan. The data from the National Health Interview Survey were linked to the 2005 computerized claims data from the National Health Insurance, and from that, the outpatient expenditures and number of outpatient episodes were identified. The contribution of self-rated health, activities of daily living, the presence of major diseases, and self-rated health were estimated using ordinary least squares regressions. Results Controlling for self-rated health alone almost eliminates the positive relationship between depressive symptoms and number of outpatient visits. After controlling for self-rated health, the utilization ratio of outpatient visits for older people with depressive symptoms reduced significantly to only 1.01 and became insignificant. A similar pattern was observed for total outpatient costs. Conclusions It was found that self-rated health is an important factor in the depressive symptomsoutpatient utilization relationship. To reduce medical costs for older people with depressive symptoms, it is essential that the self-rated health for this group is improved. Future studies should test the mechanism through which self-rated health impacts on medical utilization for older people with depressive symptoms.

Although first findings suggested reduced volume of the amygdala, pronounced gray matter decreases in frontal regions were observed in another group of pedophilic offenders. When compared to non-sexual offenders instead of community controls, pedophiles revealed deficiencies in white matter only. The present study sought to test the hypotheses of structurally compromised prefrontal and limbic networks and whether structural brain abnormalities are related to phenotypic characteristics in pedophiles. We compared gray matter volume of male pedophilic offenders and non-sexual offenders from high-security forensic hospitals using voxel-based morphometry in cross-sectional and correlational whole-brain analyses. The significance threshold was set to p < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons. Compared to controls, pedophiles exhibited a volume reduction of the right amygdala (small volume corrected). Within the pedophilic group, pedosexual interest and sexual recidivism were correlated with gray matter decrease in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (r = -.64) and insular cortex (r = -.45). Lower age of victims was strongly associated with gray matter reductions in the orbitofrontal cortex (r = .98) and angular gyri bilaterally (r = .70 and r = .93). Our findings of specifically impaired neural networks being related to certain phenotypic characteristics might account for the heterogeneous results in previous neuroimaging studies of pedophilia.

Polymorphisms in genes that putatively influence serotonergic neurotransmission increase the vulnerability for developing PD specifically in males. We tested the hypotheses that serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding is elevated in PD subjects vs. healthy controls in regions where in vivo evidence exists for both elevated 5-HTT and 5-HT1A receptor levels in PD and investigated whether the extent of this difference depends upon gender. Volunteers were out-patients with current PD (n=24) and healthy controls (n=24). The non-displaceable component of 5-HTT binding-potential (BPND) was measured using positron emission tomography and the 5-HTT selective radioligand, [C-11]DASB. PD severity was assessed using the PD Severity Scale. The 5-HTT-BPND was increased in males with PD relative to male controls in the anterior cingulate cortex (F=8.96, p(FDR)=0.01) and midbrain (F=5.09, p(FDR)=0.03). In contrast, BPND did not differ between females with PD and female controls in any region examined. The finding that 5-HTT-binding is elevated in males but not in females with PD converges with other evidence suggesting that dysfunction within the central serotonergic system exists in PD, and also indicates that such abnormalities are influenced by gender. These findings conceivably may reflect a sexual dimorphism that underlies the greater efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in females vs. males with PD.","2013-05","2018-12-21 18:13:51","2018-12-21 18:13:51","","733-743","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","[C-11]DASB; 5-HTT; Cingulate cortex; insula; positron emission tomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urinary F2 isoprostane excretion was significantly higher in patients with depression than in control subjects. This association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex and BMI. Depression symptom severity scores were not correlated with F2 isoprostane excretion. Nine patients were treated with sertraline or bupropion for 8 weeks. Depression severity rating scale scores decreased significantly and F2 isoprostane excretion increased. The increase in F2 isoprostane excretion was inversely correlated with the improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating 17 items. In conclusion, oxidative stress is increased in patients with depression. However, although treatment with either bupropion or sertraline reduces the symptoms of depression, it may increase F2 isoprostane excretion. These results suggest that alternative mechanisms, beyond oxidative stress, may be involved in the development of depression and subsequent responses to treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Anticipation of aversive events is often associated with an intense emotional state in individuals with PTSD. Both the valence (i.e., positive or negative) of the anticipated event and the degree of temporal predictability (i.e., one's ability to predict when an event will occur) have profound effects on an individual's emotional experience. This investigation tested the hypothesis that individuals with combat-related PTSD would show increased activation in the insula and related emotion-processing circuitry when anticipating emotionally significant events such as portrayed in combat-related images, and this heighted response within the insula would be particularly enhanced during temporal unpredictability. Methods: About 15 male veterans with PTSD and 15 male veterans with combat-exposure but no current or lifetime history of PTSD (combat exposed controls/CEC) performed a temporal unpredictability anticipation task of unpleasant (combat-related) and pleasant images during fMRI. Results: As expected, greater activation in the bilateral anterior insulae was observed in the PTSD versus the CEC subjects during anticipation of combat-related images when the anticipatory period was of uncertain duration (p<0.05). Furthermore, activation in the right anterior insula was related to greater perceived threat in the CEC group (rho=0.619). Limitations: The current study looks only at combat-related PTSD in a modest preliminary sized sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that an excessive anticipatory reaction in individuals with PTSD to temporally unpredictable aversive stimulus may relate to greater perceived threat. These findings are concordant with psychological models of PTSD that focus on the association of PTSD with the experience of decreased predictability and control.

Multiyear intervention addressed social-cognitive processes through social-skill training groups, parent groups, classroom curricula, peer coaching, and tutoring. Assigning children to the intervention decreased their mean antisocial-behavior score after Grade 9 by 0.16 standardized units (p<.01). Structural equation models indicated that 27% of the intervention's impact on antisocial behavior was mediated by its impact on three social-cognitive processes: reducing hostile-attribution biases, increasing competent response generation to social problems, and devaluing aggression.

As these disorders are often observed in individuals prenatally exposed to cigarette smoking, we tested the hypothesis that such exposure impairs central myelination in adolescence, an important period of brain development and the peak age of onset of psychiatric disorders. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were treated with nicotine (3 mg kg(-1) per day; gestational nicotine (GN)) or gestational saline via osmotic mini pumps from gestational days 4-18. Both male and female offsprings were killed on postnatal day 35 or 36, and three limbic brain regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens, were removed for measurement of gene expression and determination of morphological changes using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) array, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. GN altered myelin gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, with striking sex differences. Aberrant expression of myelin-related transcription and trophic factors was seen in GN animals, which correlated highly with the alterations in the myelin gene expression. These correlations suggest that these factors contribute to GN-induced alterations in myelin gene expression and also indicate abnormal function of oligodendrocytes (OLGs), the myelin-producing cells in the CNS. It is unlikely that these changes are attributable solely to an alteration in the number of OLGs, as the cell number was changed only in the PFC of GN males. Together, our findings suggest that abnormal brain myelination underlies various psychiatric disorders and drug abuse associated with prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke.","2013-04","2018-12-21 18:13:58","2018-12-21 18:13:58","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","adolescence; gestation; myelin; nicotine; oligodendrocyte; smoking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One hundred participants were assigned to read either an essay or a short story (out of a set of 8 essays and 8 short stories matched for length, reading difficulty, and interest). After reading, their need for cognitive closure was assessed. As hypothesized, when compared to participants in the essay condition, participants in the short story condition experienced a significant decrease in self-reported need for cognitive closure.

The current theories on the working mechanism hypothesize that individuals with BN might be caught in a (psycho)bio-behavioral bind and suggest a circle of weight loss, weight suppression, weight gain, and binge eating that in theory should also apply to a broad spectrum of binge eating symptomatology. This study was intended to test the hypothesis that WS predicts current binge eating with a loss of control (BE + LOC) in a population-based sample. We used a population-sample of participants (N = 3,512) who responded to a survey in a women's magazine. In a logistic regression analysis, WS did not predict current BE + LOC, in contrast to high diet activity in the past year. Possible explanations for the lack of association are discussed.

However, when the task placed a high load on cognitive control resources, we found that angry-face feedback attenuated age-related deficits in initial rule learning and set shifting whereas happy-face feedback led to age-related deficits in initial rule learning and set shifting.

Survivors' well-being may be further compromised by exposure to chronic stressors common to this population, including difficulties arising from costly medical care, changes in employment status, and health insurance coverage. Thus, we hypothesized that financial, employment, and insurance stressors (collectively referred to as economic survivorship stressors) would be associated with poorer health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among hematopoietic stem cell transplantation survivors. Methods Survivors (n=181; M=640 days post-transplant) completed the measures of study variables through mailed questionnaires and telephone interviews. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized associations between economic survivorship stressors and HRQOL, and to examine whether social and situational factors interact with survivors' stress perceptions to predict HRQOL. Results Greater financial and employment stress were associated with poorer functioning across multiple HRQOL domains, even after controlling for the effects of possible confounding sociodemographic and medical variables. Insurance stress was not associated with HRQOL. Some associations were moderated by situational factors including timing of the current financial crisis and portion of the transplant paid for by health insurance. Conclusions Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation survivors can face serious economic challenges during recovery. Results suggest the value of viewing these challenges as chronic stressors capable of reducing survivors' mental and physical well-being.

Cognitive style is an important target for intervention because although it is not possible to remove the stress and adversities in people's lives, it may be possible to modify interpretation of such adversities through cognitive style. Children may develop a negative cognitive style through modeling the style of their mothers. However, findings have been inconsistent on the association. The authors tested the hypothesis that there is an independent association between maternal and offspring depressogenic cognitive style. Method: Data from over 4,000 mothers and children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort study in the United Kingdom were used to investigate the association between maternal depressogenic cognitive style before the offspring's birth and the offspring's depressogenic cognitive style at age 18. Results: A positive association was observed between maternal and offspring cognitive styles: a one-standard-deviation increase in maternal depressogenic cognitive style score during pregnancy was significantly associated with a mean increase of 0.1 standard deviations in offspring depressogenic cognitive style score at age 18. This effect remained after adjusting for maternal and offspring depression and explained 21% of the association between maternal and offspring depression. Conclusions: Although the mechanisms remain to be elucidated, the findings are consistent with the idea that a mother's cognitive style (irrespective of her depression status) influences that of her child. This suggests that interventions to improve a mother's cognitive style could help prevent her offspring from developing depression during adulthood.

We tested the hypothesis that altered processing of pain within the insula might account for reduced perception of pain. Method: Heat pain thresholds were obtained in nineteen patients with AN and matched controls. Thereafter, a thermode was used to deliver thermal painful stimuli to the right arm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements. Stimuli were initiated for 10s from a baseline resting temperature (32 degrees C) to three different levels (37, 42, 45 degrees C). Results: Significantly increased heat pain thresholds were observed in patients. A stronger activation during heat pain perception was found in the left posterior insula in controls. In contrast, higher levels of activity were shown in the ipsilateral pons in patients when compared to controls. In patients, we found a significant interrelation between the depression score (Beck depression inventory) and heat pain activations. Conclusion: We suggest that reduced activity in the left posterior insula might contribute to increased pain thresholds in patients, while increased activations in the right anterior insula and pons mirror augmented sympathetic modulation putatively related to amplification of adrenergic descending pain inhibition. In addition, pain thresholds and brain activations were influenced by disease-inherent depressed mood.","2013-04","2018-12-21 18:14:09","2018-12-21 18:14:09","","269-278","","4","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","anorexia nervosa; autonomic nervous system; descending pain inhibition; functional magnetic resonance imaging; pain perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two hundred and twenty participants read a message that contained either strong vs. weak quality counter-attitudinal arguments (anti-voluntary euthanasia) in the morning (9.00 a.m.) or in the evening (7.00 p.m.). When tested at their respective optimal time-of-day (for both M- and E-types) there was a reliable difference in attitude change between the strong vs. weak messages (indicating message processing had occurred) while there was no difference between strong vs. weak messages when tested at their non-optimal time-of-day. In addition, the amount of message-congruent thinking mediated the attitude change. The results show that M- and E-types pay greater attention to and elaborate on a persuasive message at their optimal time-of-day, and this leads to increased attitude change, compared to those tested at their non-optimal time-of-day.

For individuals with chronic illness, acceptance of its presence and consequences is necessary to seek appropriate treatment, adjust their lifestyle, and adhere to recommended management strategies. Some have difficulty adjusting out of the sick role or develop a degree of illness investment. The Illness Cognitions Scale (ICS) is a 17-item validated scale that measures cognitive factors associated with the sick role. We conducted analyses to test the hypothesis that there may be an association between illness cognitions and clinical and functional measures. Methods: The ICS was administered to 89 participants at the final study visit of a 24-month observational study involving patients with bipolar I disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Results: Higher scores on the ICS were correlated with more severe depression (p < 0.0001), worse general health (p=0.0002), worse functioning (p=0.0001), and worse scores in psychosocial measures including the State Hope Scale (p=0.0082), the Social Provisions Scale (p=0.0054) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (p=0.0025). Conclusions: Illness cognitions and behavior may be a neglected factor that could influence treatment outcomes in bipolar disorder. The ICS might be useful for identifying individuals whose recovery may be facilitated by targeted psychological intervention that addresses these factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

According to this hypothesis, a subject may be correct about a stimulus without being correct about how she had access to this knowledge (whether the stimulus was visual, auditory, or something else). We test this hypothesis in healthy subjects, asking them to report whether a masked stimulus was presented auditorily or visually, what the stimulus was, and how clearly they experienced the stimulus using the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS). We suggest that knowledge about perceptual modality may be a necessary precondition in order to issue correct reports of which stimulus was presented. Furthermore, we find that PAS ratings correlate with correctness, and that subjects are at chance level when reporting no conscious experience of the stimulus. To demonstrate that particular levels of reporting accuracy are obtained, we employ a statistical strategy, which operationally tests the hypothesis of non-equality, such that the usual rejection of the null-hypothesis admits the conclusion of equivalence.","2013-03-18","2018-12-21 18:14:12","2018-12-21 18:14:12","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","auditory perception; consciousness; experience; multimodal integration; visual perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By acquiring functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a pain-anticipation task, we tested the hypothesis that individuals with MDD would show increased negative biasing that may be associated with reduced frontal connectivity. Thirty-one (15 females) unmedicated young adults with current MDD and 22 (11 females) healthy subjects with no history of MDD were recruited. Groups did not differ significantly in age, race, level of education, marital status or gender distribution. fMRI data were collected during an event-related pain-anticipation paradigm, during which subjects were cued to anticipate painful heat stimuli of high or low intensity. All temperature stimuli were applied to each subject's left forearm. We found that relative to healthy comparison subjects, participants with MDD showed significantly stronger responses to high versus low pain anticipation within right ventral anterior insula (AI), but overlapping response within right dorsal AI, which correlated positively with the depression symptoms severity in the MDD group. Functional connectivity analyses showed increased functional connectivity between dorsal insula and posterior thalamus and decreased functional connectivity between dorsal insula and the right inferior frontal gyrus in the MDD compared with the non-MDD group. Our results demonstrate that unmedicated individuals with current MDD compared with healthy never-depressed subjects show both differential and overlapping response within AI during anticipation of pain. Furthermore, the overlapping insular response is less regulated by frontal brain systems and is more subservient to affective processing regions in the posterior thalamus in MDD. These results support and provide functional validation of the co-occurring enhanced `bottom-up' and attenuated `top-down' processing of salient, unpleasant emotional information in MDD.","2013-03","2018-12-21 18:14:13","2018-12-21 18:14:13","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","depression; emotion; fMRI; imaging; insula; modulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generalizing previous research findings to this non-typical stigmatized group, perceiving discrimination as pervasive and legitimate affected group commitment.

We also explored if tobacco deprivation moderated affect-urge relations and compared the effects of PA and NA on smoking urge to one another. At a baseline session, smokers reported affect experienced over the preceding few weeks. At a subsequent experimental session, participants were randomly assigned to 12-hr tobacco deprived (n = 51) or nondeprived (n = 69) conditions and reported state affect and current urge. Results revealed a mediational pathway whereby prior NA reported at baseline predicted state NA at the experimental session, which in turn predicted current urge. This mediational pathway was found primarily for an urge subtype indicative of urgent need to smoke and desire to smoke for NA relief, was stronger in the deprived (vs. nondeprived) condition, and remained significant after controlling for PA. Prior PA and current state PA were inversely associated with current urge; however, these associations were eliminated after controlling for NA. These results cohere with negative reinforcement models of addiction and with prior research and suggest that: (a) NA plays a stronger role in smoking motivation than PA; (b) state affect is an important mechanism linking prior affective experience to current urge; and (c) affect management interventions may attenuate smoking urge in individuals with a history of affective disturbance.","2013-03","2018-12-21 18:14:17","2018-12-21 18:14:17","","262-267","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","craving; negative affect; positive affect; smoking; urge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We suggest that characteristics of the learning instantiation alone can give rise to different levels of transfer. We propose that concreteness of the learning instantiation can hinder analogical transfer of well-defined structured concepts, such as mathematical concepts. We operationalize the term concreteness as the amount of information communicated through a specific instantiation of a concept. The 5 reported experiments with undergraduate students tested the hypothesis by presenting participants with the concept of a commutative mathematical group of order 3. The experiments varied the level of concreteness of the training instantiation and measured transfer of learning to a new instantiation. The results support the hypothesis, demonstrating better transfer from more generic instantiations (i.e., ones that communicate minimal extraneous information) than from more concrete instantiations. Specifically, concreteness was found to create an obstacle to successful structural alignment across domains, whereas generic instantiations led to spontaneous structural alignment. These findings have important implications for the theory of learning and transfer and practical implications for the design of educational material. Although some concreteness may activate prior knowledge and perhaps offer a leg up in the learning process, this benefit may come at the cost of transfer.","2013-03","2018-12-21 18:14:19","2018-12-21 18:14:19","","14-29","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","analogy; concreteness; learning; transfer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study tested the hypothesis that stress increases reward salience, leading to more effective learning about positive than negative outcomes in a probabilistic selection task. Changes to dopamine pathways with age raise the question of whether stress effects on incentive-based learning differ by age. Thus, the present study also examined whether effects of stress on reinforcement learning differed for younger (age 18-34) and older participants (age 65-85). Cold pressor stress was administered to half of the participants in each age group, and salivary cortisol levels were used to confirm biophysiological response to cold stress. After the manipulation, participants completed a probabilistic learning task involving positive and negative feedback. In both younger and older adults, stress enhanced learning about cues that predicted positive outcomes. In addition, during the initial learning phase, stress diminished sensitivity to recent feedback across age groups. These results indicate that stress affects reinforcement learning in both younger and older adults and suggests that stress exerts different effects on specific components of reinforcement learning depending on their neural underpinnings.","2013-03","2018-12-21 18:14:20","2018-12-21 18:14:20","","35-46","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; cortisol; probabilistic reinforcement learning; reward; stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unitization is an encoding process defined by creation of a new single entity to represent a new arbitrary association. The current study tested the hypothesis that age-related differences in associative memory can be reduced by encoding instructions that promote unitization. In two experiments, groups of 20 young and 20 older participants learned new associations between a word and a background color under two conditions. In the item detail condition, they had to imagine that the item is the same color as the background-an instruction promoting unitization of the associations. In the context detail condition, which did not promote unitization, they had to imagine that the item interacted with another colored object. Attest, they had to retrieve the color that was associated with each word (source memory). In both experiments, the results showed an age-related decrement in source memory performance in the context detail but not in the item detail condition. Moreover, Experiment 2 examined receiver operating characteristics in older participants and indicated that familiarity contributed more to source memory performance in the item detail than in the context detail condition. These findings suggest that unitization of new associations can overcome the associative memory deficit observed in aging, at least for item-color associations.","2013-03","2018-12-21 18:14:21","2018-12-21 18:14:21","","275-283","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aging; associative memory; source memory; unitization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cohort of 984 Students in the College Life Study at a large public university in the US participated in a longitudinal prospective study. Interviewers assessed NPS; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) cannabis and alcohol use disorders; and frequency of skipping class. Semester grade point average (GPA) was obtained from the university. Control variables were race, sex, family income, high school GPA, and self-reported attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis. Longitudinal growth curve modeling of four annual data waves estimated the associations among the rates of change of cannabis use disorder, percentage of classes skipped, and semester GPA. The associations between these trajectories and NPS for studying were then evaluated. A second structural model substituted alcohol use disorder for cannabis use disorder. More than one-third (38%) reported NPS for studying at least once by Year 4. Increases in skipping class were associated with both alcohol and cannabis use disorder, which were associated with declining GPA. The hypothesized relationships between these trajectories and NPS for studying were confirmed. These longitudinal findings suggest that escalation of substance use problems during college is related to increases in skipping class and to declining academic performance. NPS for studying is associated with academic difficulties. Although additional research is needed to investigate causal pathways, these results suggest that nonmedical users of prescription stimulants could benefit from a comprehensive drug and alcohol assessment to possibly mitigate future academic declines.

The present study investigates the extent to which the previously validated Intolerance for Smoking Abstinence Discomfort Questionnaire (IDQ-S) scales share variance with (a) laboratory measures of distress tolerance (Paced Serial Addition Task and a breath-holding task) that have themselves been validated against smoking history, (b) the cold pressor task (not previously validated for smoking), and (c) an anxiety sensitivity questionnaire previously used for a similar purpose. The study then tests the hypothesis that the IDQ-S scales will have a higher correlation with smoking rate and dependence and with number and length of past smoking cessation attempts than with anxiety sensitivity or behavioral distress tolerance tasks do, since those measures are not smoking-specific. Methods: Sixty daily smokers recruited from the community completed the measures. Results: The behavioral tasks and anxiety sensitivity shared little common variance. Anxiety sensitivity correlated more highly with IDQ-S than did the behavioral tasks but only 27% of variance was shared with the IDQ-S Withdrawal Intolerance; no distress tolerance measure correlated significantly with the IDQ-S Lack of Cognitive Coping scale. Only the IDQ-S scales correlated significantly with nicotine dependence, rate and past cessation: Withdrawal Intolerance with nicotine dependence and rate, and Lack of Cognitive Coping with fewer quit attempts. Conclusions: The smoking-specific measure of intolerance for discomfort may be more useful in smoking research than the less specific measures of distress tolerance.

Declarative WM holds the objects of thought available, whereas procedural WM holds representations of what to do with these objects. Both systems consist of three embedded components: activated long-term memory, a central capacity-limited component for building structures through temporary bindings, and a single-element focus of attention. Five experiments test the hypothesis of analogous mechanisms in declarative and procedural WM, investigating repetition effects across trials for individual representations (objects and responses) and for sets (memory sets and task sets), as well as set-congruency effects. Evidence for analogous processes was obtained from three phenomena: (1) Costs of task switching and of list switching are reduced with longer preparation interval. (2) The effects of task congruency and of list congruency are undiminished with longer preparation interval. (3) Response repetition interacts with task repetition in procedural WM; here we show an analogous interaction of list repetition with item repetition in declarative WM. All three patterns were reproduced by a connectionist model implementing the assumed selection and updating mechanisms. The model consists of two modules, an item-selection module selecting individual items from a memory set, or responses from a task set, and a set-selection module for selecting memory sets or task sets. The model codes the matrix of binding weights in the item-selection module as a pattern of activation in the set-selection module, thereby providing a mechanism for building chunks in LTM, and for unpacking them as structures into working memory.

However, existing empirical work has not tested this notion conclusively, given that studies have associated larger degrees of dishonesty with larger payoffs. It thus remains unclear whether people actually do avoid major lies or rather shy away from large (unjustified) payoffs, e.g. since the latter are generally more likely to trigger suspicion. Thus, we critically tested the hypothesis that the probability of dishonesty is a decreasing function of the distance between the actual truth and the lie that is necessary to increase ones gains. In a modified dice-game paradigm, a highly specific behavioral pattern was predicted by this hypothesis and results from a large (N = 765), incentivized and fully anonymous study confirmed the latter, thus corroborating that people indeed avoid major lies.

Some of the metabolic alterations can already exist in psychosis-prone subjects prior to the onset of chronic schizophrenic disease and pharmacotherapy, indicating that they may have a developmental origin. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic alterations pertinent to schizophrenic disease can be primed by an environmental risk factor associated with the disorder, namely prenatal exposure to immune challenge. We used a well-established mouse model of prenatal immune challenge induced by maternal gestational treatment with poly(I:C) (=”polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid”), an analog of double-stranded RNA that stimulates a cytokine-associated viral-like acute phase response. Metabolic effects were studied using high-resolution computed tomography and fully automated indirect calorimetry system, along with an oral glucose tolerance test and plasma cytokine and corticosterone measurements. We found that prenatal immune activation caused altered glycemic regulation and abnormal ingestive behavior in periadolescence and led to an adult onset of excess visceral and subcutaneous fat deposition. These effects were accompanied by age-dependent changes in peripheral secretion of proinflammatory (interleukin [IL]-6 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) and T cell related (IL-2 and interferon [IFN]-gamma) cytokines and by increased release of the stress hormone corticosterone in periadolescence. Our findings show that schizophrenia-relevant metabolic and physiological abnormalities can be primed by prenatal viral-like immune activation, but at the same time, our study emphasizes that this environmental insult is unlikely to precipitate the full spectrum of metabolic and immunological changes pertinent to chronic schizophrenic disease.","2013-03","2018-12-21 18:14:28","2018-12-21 18:14:28","","319-329","","2","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cytokines; immune activation; maternal infection; metabolic disease; obesity; poly(I:C); schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nineteen healthy Asian male participants were insulted and asked to control their anger during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). When cortisol levels were low, testosterone positively correlated with activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and thalamus, but not when cortisol levels were high. During induced anger control, functional connectivity was increased between the amygdala and a top-down prefrontal cortical control network. Moreover, the amygdala-PFC connectivity was strongest among those high in testosterone and low in cortisol.

Participants steered an object within a narrow path and discriminated the color of a flash that appeared briefly close to the object. Across two experiments, participants provided higher ratings of perceived control when an object moved over a flash's location than when an object moved away from a flash's location.

Furthermore, this illusory sense of fairness derived from the mere presence of diversity structures causes high-status group members to legitimize the status quo by becoming less sensitive to discrimination targeted at underrepresented groups and reacting more harshly toward underrepresented group members who claim discrimination. Six experiments support these hypotheses in designs using 4 types of diversity structures (diversity policies, diversity training, diversity awards, idiosyncratically generated diversity structures from participants' own organizations) among 2 high-status groups in tests involving several types of discrimination (discriminatory promotion practices, adverse impact in hiring, wage discrimination).

It appears that they use the estimation of time (or trial number) into the session, rather than (or in addition to) the more reliable cue, the outcome from the previous trial (i.e., a win-stay/lose-shift response rule), to determine which stimulus they should choose. In the present research, we investigated several variables that we thought might encourage pigeons to use a more efficient response strategy. In Experiment 1, we used a treadle-stepping response, rather than key pecking, to test the hypothesis that reflexive key pecking may have biased pigeons to estimate the time (or trial number) into the session at which the reversal would occur. In Experiment 2, we attempted to make the point of reversal in the session more salient by inserting irrelevant trials with stimuli different from the original discriminative stimuli, and for a separate group, we added a 5-s time-out penalty following incorrect choices. The use of a treadle-stepping response did not improve reversal performance, and although we found some improvement in reversal performance when the reversal was signaled and when errors resulted in a time-out, we found little evidence for performance that approached the win-stay/lose-shift accuracy shown by rats.","2013-03","2018-12-21 18:14:34","2018-12-21 18:14:34","","54-60","","1","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anticipatory errors; Perseverative errors; Pigeons; Reversal learning; Simultaneous discrimination; Spatial discrimination; Visual discrimination; Win-stay/lose-shift","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cognitive self-consciousness (CSC; i.e., a preoccupation with one's thoughts) may increase awareness of MCB, potentially triggering the onset of psychotic symptoms. This study tested the hypotheses that (1), MCB would moderate affective and symptomatic reactions to stress in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis, and (2), greater CSC would precede worsening in psychotic symptoms in individuals with strong MCB. Method: Twenty-seven individuals at UHR of developing psychosis completed a self-report diary when prompted by an electronic wristwatch several times each day for 6 days (experience sampling). Results: MCB moderated the association between affective, but not symptomatic, responses to social stress. CSC preceded the subsequent occurrence of hallucinations in individuals who reported strong beliefs about the need to control their thoughts. Conclusions: The data suggest that MCB sensitize an individual to social stressors. CSC may represent times where an individual is aware that their thoughts are uncontrollable, and therefore contradicting their MCB, motivating them to make an external attribution.

Questionnaire data were used from a 2-wave longitudinal study of a community sample of 881 young Swedish adolescents. The results showed that 7 % of the girls reported poor sleep (never or seldom sleeping well), and 20-26 % of the girls reported repeated NSSI (at least 5 instances). Poor sleep was associated prospectively with NSSI among girls, but not among boys. Of girls who responded that they seldom or never slept well at T1, 77 % reported repeated NSSI 1 year later. Poor sleep at T1 was found to predict the incidence of new cases of repeated NSSI in girls at T2, independently of their degree of psychopathology. No similar relationship between poor sleep and NSSI was found in boys. The present results suggest that screening for poor sleep in adolescents may serve to identify a subgroup of girls at risk for developing NSSI.

The aim of this study is to characterize behavior in MCI compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy older patients. Design A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a prospective, longitudinal study on behavioral symptoms of dementia and MCI was performed. The study population consisted of 270 MCI, 402 AD patients, and 108 healthy controls. Behavioral assessment was performed by means of Middelheim Frontality Score, Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Results Moderate-to-severe behavioral symptoms were present in 13% of MCI patients, as compared with 39% in AD patients and 3% in controls (p<0.001). The general severity of behavioral symptoms was intermediate between controls and AD patients. The three most frequent symptoms in MCI patients were aggressiveness (49%), affective disturbance (45%), and anxiety (38%); in AD patients, the most frequent symptoms were aggressiveness (60%), activity disturbances (54%), and psychosis (40%). The prevalence and severity of frontal lobe symptoms, aggressiveness, activity disturbances, and delusions was intermediate between normal aging and AD. In addition, the severity of physically non-aggressive and verbally agitated behavior and the severity of depressive symptoms were also intermediate. Conclusions The behavioral profile of MCI patients is characterized as an intermediate state between normal aging and AD for the prevalence and severity of certain behavioral symptoms.

This study is based on survey responses from 235 Chinese employees collected at two time points with 3 months in between. We conducted moderated regression analyses to test the hypotheses that employees higher in extraversion or conscientiousness or lower in neuroticism would demonstrate a stronger TMX-work engagement relation. Results from this study showed that the three focal personality traits moderated the TMX-engagement relation simultaneously. Specifically, the positive TMX-engagement relation was stronger for employees with higher extraversion or lower neuroticism than that for their counterparts. Interestingly, the TMX-engagement relation was positive for employees lower in conscientiousness but negative for those higher in conscientiousness. These findings support the notion that lateral social exchange relationships in the workplace (i.e., TMX) are an important antecedent of work engagement and, more importantly, their beneficial effects on work engagement are contingent on certain types and/or levels of personality traits.

This might include disturbed interactions between the M and parvocellular (P) pathways and especially impaired M priming, which can disturb highlighting of relevant information. Such disorders may result from neurodevelopmental irregularities, which are assumed to be substantially involved in schizophrenia. This study sought to test the hypothesis that M priming is impaired in schizophrenia. In order to elucidate this neurodevelopmental aspect, we investigated patients with different ages of schizophrenia onset. This provided a useful design to integrate visual information processing in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Method: Nine stimulus conditions were used to investigate the M-and P-pathways and their interaction in a pattern reversal VEP paradigm. N80 generators were analyzed using source localization (Brain Electrical Source Analysis software: BESA). Forty schizophrenia patients (early-onset=19; adult-onset=21) were compared with age-and gender-matched healthy controls (early-onset controls=19; adult-onset controls=21). Hypotheses were tested using a bootstrap resampling procedure. Results: The N80 component was represented by a single dipole located in the occipital visual cortex. The bootstrap analysis yielded significant differences between early-onset schizophrenia patients and controls. We found lower amplitudes in response to mixed M-P conditions and normal amplitudes in response to isolated P-and M-biased stimulation. Concerning the latencies, significant differences were found between adult-onset subjects and their controls, with prolonged latencies for schizophrenia patients. Conclusions: The early VEP component N80 evoked by mixed M-P conditions is assumed to be a correlate of M priming and showed reduced amplitude in early-onset schizophrenic patients but not in adult-onset patients. These findings point towards an M priming deficit in early-onset patients and are compatible with a neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, probably reflecting asynchronies in brain maturational abnormalities occurring at different ages of illness onset.

Methods: Twenty depressed and twenty never depressed individuals completed a memory diary, recording 10 involuntary and 10 voluntary autobiographical memories. Psychiatric status (assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, SCID-1), psychopathology, rumination, avoidance and executive function were assessed prior to completion of the memory diary. Results: Both groups were more specific during involuntary than voluntary memory retrieval. No overall group differences were identified. However, when non-remitted depressed participants were compared to partially remitted and never depressed participants the expected interaction was identified; non-remitted depressed individuals were less specific during voluntary, but not during involuntary recall. Consistent with theory, negative correlations between memory specificity, rumination and avoidance were also present. Limitations: The study presents an important yet preliminary finding which warrants Further replication with a larger sample size.

In these experiments we tested the hypothesis that similar physiological responses can be evoked by observing emotional face and body signals and that the reaction to angry signals is amplified in anxious individuals. We designed three experiments in which participants categorized emotional expressions from isolated facial and bodily expressions and emotionally congruent and incongruent face-body compounds. Participants' fixations were measured and their pupil size recorded with eye-tracking equipment and their facial reactions measured with electromyography. The results support our prediction that the recognition of a facial expression is improved in the context of a matching posture and importantly, vice versa as well. From their facial expressions, it appeared that observers acted with signs of negative emotionality (increased corrugator activity) to angry and fearful facial expressions and with positive emotionality (increased zygomaticus) to happy facial expressions. What we predicted and found, was that angry and fearful cues from the face or the body, attracted more attention than happy cues. We further observed that responses evoked by angry cues were amplified in individuals with high anxiety scores. In sum, we show that people process bodily expressions of emotion in a similar fashion as facial expressions and that the congruency between the emotional signals from the face and body facilitates the recognition of the emotion.","2013-02-08","2018-12-21 18:14:43","2018-12-21 18:14:43","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","electromyography; emotional body language; facial expressions; fixations; pupil dilation; scenes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants rated each memory on scales hypothesised to be indicators of one of four latent constructs. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses and structural analyses confirmed the similarity of the latent constructs of recollection, belief, impact, and rehearsal, as well as the similarity of the structural relationships among those constructs across memory type.

However, little research has indicated association between mindfulness and sexuality. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that mindfulness correlates with sexuality in healthy people. We conducted a cross-sectional study with people who practice yoga or meditation (n = 51), people who have done a sport for over 10years (n = 21) and people who have done none of the above (n = 145) by studying correlations between mindfulness and sexuality. A total of 215 men and women participated in this study (M = 31.61, SD = 9.24). We measured mindfulness and sexuality by distri-buting the Langer's Mindfulness Scale and the Multidimensional Sexuality Questionnaire. We explored whether mindfulness subscales correlate with any of the sexuality subscales in these three study groups, irrespectively. People in the meditation/yoga group had been practicing mindfulness and different meditative practices (including vipassana and yoga) for over 10years. We found significant higher scores in the novelty-seeking component in people who meditate compared to athletes. Even though our results showed that the group of people who do a sport have less sexual anxiety and sexual depression compared to the meditators, these results were not at a statistically significant level. Additionally, no significant differences were found between the other groups. We found positive correlations between all mindfulness subscales (engagement, novelty seeking, novelty producing and flexibility) and sexual motivation, and between novelty seeking and sexual consciousness. Our findings seem to indicate that mindfulness correlates positively with sexual motivation and sexual consiousness. In particular, people who practice meditation or yoga showed higher levels in novelty seeking (mindfulness subscale) compared to people who play sport. Novelty seeking might be an important component in affecting sexuality.","2013-02-01","2018-12-21 18:14:45","2018-12-21 18:14:45","","29-38","","1-2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","behavior; mindfulness; sexuality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, evidence for this dissociation has only been observed using a limited number of experimental paradigms. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we tested the hypothesis that conscious processing during retrieval can occur in BA17/18 using memorial paradigms that recruited processing in these early visual regions. During the encoding phase of Experiment 1, abstract shapes with colored and oriented internal lines were presented to the left and right of fixation. During the retrieval phase, old shapes and new shapes were presented at fixation and participants classified each item as “old-left”, “old-right”, or “new”. The contrast of spatial memory-hits > spatial memory-misses (with accurate item memory) produced activity in BA17/18. During the encoding phase of Experiment 2, abstract shapes with colored and oriented internal lines were presented at fixation. During the retrieval phase, old shapes, changed shapes (with the same outline but different colored and oriented internal lines), and new shapes were presented at fixation and participants made an old-new classification during runs with a specific retrieval orientation or a non-specific retrieval orientation. Critically, the contrast of old-hits > old-misses during specific retrieval orientation produced activity in BA17/18. The results of the present experiments support the hypothesis that conscious processing during retrieval can occur in BA17/18. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The eCB system also has an important role in reward mechanisms, and nicotine addiction has been associated with aberrant reward processing. Motivated by this evidence, we tested the hypothesis that eCB modulation of reward processing is altered in subjects with a nicotine addiction (NAD). For this purpose, we compared reward-related activity in NAD with healthy controls (HC) in a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study using Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration to challenge the eCB system. Eleven HC and 10 NAD participated in a 3-T functional MRI (fMRI) study with a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design, using a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) paradigm with three reward levels. Reward activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate putamen during anticipation and feedback of reward was compared after THC and placebo. fMRI results indicated a significant reduction of reward anticipation activity in the NAcc in NAD after THC administration, which was not present in HC. This is indicated by a significant group by drug by reward interaction. Our data show that THC significantly reduces the NAcc response to monetary reward anticipation in NAD. These results suggest that nicotine addiction is associated with altered eCB modulation of reward processing in the NAcc. This study adds important human data to existing evidence implicating the eCB system in nicotine addiction.

For that purpose, we examined the effects of a working memory and an emotional Go/Nogo task on cognitive control in an emotional and a nonemotional variant of the Stroop paradigm. The data confirmed the hypothesized dissociation: Working memory efforts selectively suppressed conflict regulation in the nonemotional Stroop task, while the demands of an emotional Go/Nogo task impaired only conflict regulation in the emotional Stroop task.

In this within-subjects design, hazard perception performance was compared between high and no cognitive load conditions (with or without a puzzle to solve). We tested 17 participants, all of whom were required to be in possession of a DVLA approved driving license and had completed the hazard perception portion of the British driving test. A novel dual-task paradigm, which did not require subjects to process or produce verbal information during the primary task, was employed to increase participants' cognitive load. Participants were assessed on three categories of performance measures: behavioural, eye movements and cortical activity between both high and no cognitive load conditions whilst watching 20 clips from a hazard perception test. This study was run in a laboratory of the Psychology Research Wing at the University of Dundee. Behavioural findings from the hazard perception test indicate significantly increased reaction times to hazardous stimuli and significantly increased false alarm rates to non-hazardous stimuli in the high cognitive load condition (when contemplating a previous conversation). Analyses of eye movements indicated significant increases in blink frequencies, higher saccade peak velocities and a significant reduction in the spread of fixations along the horizontal axis. Results from EEG recordings showed a significant increase in frontal and a significant decrease in occipital theta activity within the high load condition. Findings were interpreted within the framework of Corbetta, Patel and Schulmann's (2008) networks model of attention control. Our findings suggest that preoccupation with a recent conversation negatively influences the modulatory effect of the central executive on both the stimulus as well as goal-driven networks of the brain.

Instead, the relationship could reflect selection into marriage whereby the men who are most likely to marry (men in steady employment with high levels of education) are the least likely to engage in antisocial behavior. The relationship could also be the result of reverse causation, whereby high levels of antisocial behavior are a deterrent to marriage rather than the reverse. Both of these alternative processes are consistent with the possibility that some men have a genetically based proclivity to become married, known as an active genotype-environment correlation. Using four complementary methods, we tested the hypothesis that marriage limits men's antisocial behavior. These approaches have different strengths and weaknesses and collectively help to rule out alternative explanations, including active genotype-environment correlations, for a causal association between marriage and men's antisocial behavior. Data were drawn from the in-home interview sample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a large, longitudinal survey study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the United States. Lagged negative binomial and logistic regression and propensity scorematching models (n = 2,250), fixed-effects models of within-individual change (n = 3,061), and random-effects models of sibling differences (n 618) all showed that married men engaged in significantly less antisocial behavior than unmarried men.

Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Setting: Retirement communities across metropolitan Chicago. Participants: Nine hundred eighty-three older persons without dementia. Measurements: At baseline, neuroticism and extraversion were assessed and annual assessment of 18 motor measures were summarized in a composite measure. Results: Average follow-up was 5 years. Separate linear mixed-effects models controlling for age, sex, and education showed that baseline levels of neuroticism and extraversion were associated with the rate of motor decline. For each 7-point (similar to 1 SD) higher neuroticism score at baseline, the average annual rate of motor decline was more than 20% faster. This amount of motor decline was associated with a 10% increased risk of death compared to a participant with an average neuroticism score. Each 6-point (similar to 1 SD) lower extraversion score at baseline was associated with an 8% faster rate of motor decline. This amount of motor decline was associated with about a 9% increased risk of death compared to a participant with an average extraversion score. Neuroticism and extraversion were relatively independently associated with motor decline. These associations were unchanged when controlling for depressive symptoms and current health status but were partially attenuated when controlling for late-life cognitive and social activities.

Results We showed that both trait and daily curiosity were linked to less aggressive responses toward romantic relationship partners and people who caused psychological hurt. In time-lagged analyses, daily curiosity predicted less aggression from one day to the next, with no evidence for the reverse direction. Studies 3 and 4 showed that the inverse association between curiosity and aggression was strongest in close relationships and in fledgling (as opposed to long-lasting) romantic relationships. That is, highly curious people showed evidence of greater context sensitivity. Intensity of hurt feelings and other personality and relationship variables failed to account for these effects.

Additional research identifying early predictors of future antisocial behavior, or antisocial propensity, is needed. The present study tested the hypothesis that both concern for others and active disregard for others in distress in toddlers and young children predict antisocial behavior during middle childhood and adolescence. Methods: A representative sample of same-sex twins (N = 956) recruited in Colorado was examined. Mother-rated and researcher-observed concern and disregard for others assessed at age 1436 months were examined as predictors of parent- (age 412), teacher- (age 712), and self-reported (age 17) antisocial behavior. Results: Observed disregard for others predicted antisocial behavior assessed by three different informants (parents, teachers, and self), including antisocial behavior assessed 14 years later. It also predicted a higher order antisocial behavior factor (beta = .58, p < .01) after controlling for observed concern for others. Mother-rated disregard for others predicted parent-reported antisocial behavior. Contrary to predictions, neither mother-rated nor observed concern for others inversely predicted antisocial behavior. Results of twin analyses suggested that the covariation between observed disregard for others and antisocial behavior was due to shared environmental influences. Conclusions: Disregard for others in toddlerhood/early childhood is a strong predictor of antisocial behavior in middle childhood and adolescence. The results suggest the potential need for early assessment of disregard for others and the development of potential interventions.","2013-02","2018-12-21 18:15:03","2018-12-21 18:15:03","","157-166","","2","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Antisocial behavior; concern for others; disregard for others; empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This strategy is based on repetitive sequential selection of a spatial pattern once a correct sequence has been identified. We previously reported that electroconvulsive shock (ECS) but not magnetic seizure therapy (MST) impaired performance on a spatial working memory task in a preclinical model. Here we tested the hypothesis that ECS disrupted stereotyped patterns in the selection of spatial stimuli. In a within-subject study design, we assessed the effects of ECS, MST, and sham on stereotypy and reaction time in a preclinical model. Stereotypy was assessed by the correlation of actual and predicted response patterns of spatial stimuli. Predicted patterns were based on performance during baseline sessions. ECS resulted in lower correlations between predicted and actual responses to spatial stimuli in two of the three subjects, and it also disrupted stereotypy. For one subject, there was change in the predictability of the spatial locus of responses between experimental conditions. For all three subjects, reaction time was significantly longer in ECS, relative to MST and sham. This is the first study to examine the effect of ECS, and to contrast the effects of ECS and MST, on spatial working memory component processes. Our preliminary findings show that ECS, but not MST decreased stereotypy and increased reaction time. This line of investigation may have significant implications in our understanding cognitive component processes of memory function and impairment.","2013-02","2018-12-21 18:15:05","2018-12-21 18:15:05","","177-187","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Electroconvulsive shock (ECS); magnetic seizure therapy (MST); neurocognitive; spatial working memory; stereotypy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Cross-sectional analyses were performed on 948 participants aged 45 to 84 years at Examination 1 of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (18.4% white, 53.1% Hispanics, and 28.5% African American). LTL was determined by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and SS was measured with the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease SS inventory. Results: Across the entire sample, SS was not associated with LTL (p = .87) after adjusting for demographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status), age x sex, age x race, health (body mass index, diabetes, pulse pressure), and life-style factors (smoking, physical activity, diet); however, the interaction term age (dichotomized) x SS was significant (p = .001).

Because the putative ordering of the categories reflects an understanding of what it means to have more of the variable, it seems mandatory that the ordering of the categories is an empirical property of the assessments and not merely a property of the model used to analyze them. To provide an unequivocal interpretation of category ordering in rating formats, this article expands the original derivation of the polytomous Rasch model for ordered categories. To do so, it integrates a complex of mathematical relationships among response spaces from which a space of experimentally independent Bernoulli variables, characterized by Rasch's simple logistic model, can be inferred. From this inference, the article establishes the necessary and sufficient evidence to test the hypothesis that the required ordering of the categories is an empirical property of the assessments. This expanded derivation, which exposes how Adams, Wu, and Wilson (2012) misconstrue the model and its implications, is intended to dispel the so-called disordered threshold controversy they claim exists.","2013-02","2018-12-21 18:15:07","2018-12-21 18:15:07","","78-124","","1","73","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ordered category formats; partial credit model; polytomous Rasch model; Rasch model; rating scale model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on four line-stanzas from nineteenth and twentieth German poetry that feature end rhyme and regular meter, the present study tested the hypothesis that meter and rhyme have an impact on aesthetic liking, emotional involvement, and affective valence attributions. Hypotheses that postulate such effects have been advocated ever since ancient rhetoric and poetics, yet they have barely been empirically tested. More recently, in the field of cognitive poetics, these traditional assumptions have been readopted into a general cognitive framework. In the present experiment, we tested the influence of meter and rhyme as well as their interaction with lexicality in the aesthetic and emotional perception of poetry. Participants listened to stanzas that were systematically modified with regard to meter and rhyme and rated them. Both rhyme and regular meter led to enhanced aesthetic appreciation, higher intensity in processing, and more positively perceived and felt emotions, with the latter finding being mediated by lexicality. Together these findings clearly show that both features significantly contribute to the aesthetic and emotional perception of poetry and thus confirm assumptions about their impact put forward by cognitive poetics. The present results are explained within the theoretical framework of cognitive fluency, which links structural features of poetry with aesthetic and emotional appraisal.","2013-01-31","2018-12-21 18:15:08","2018-12-21 18:15:08","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","aesthetics; cognitive fluency; emotion; meter; poetry; rhyme","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, no studies have examined neural responses to a range of emotional expressions in PTSD with high dissociative symptoms. Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that PTSD patients with high dissociative symptoms will display increased event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes in early components (N1, P1) to threatening faces (angry, fearful), and reduced later ERP amplitudes (Vertex Positive Potential (VPP), P3) to happy faces compared to PTSD patients with low dissociative symptoms. Methods: Thirty-nine civilians with PTSD were classified as high dissociative (n = 16) or low dissociative (n = 23) according to their responses on the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale. ERPs were recorded, whilst participants viewed emotional (happy, angry, fear) and neutral facial expressions in a passive viewing task. Results: High dissociative PTSD patients displayed significantly increased N120 amplitude to the majority of facial expressions (neutral, happy, and angry) compared to low dissociative PTSD patients under conscious and preconscious conditions. The high dissociative PTSD group had significantly reduced VPP amplitude to happy faces in the conscious condition. Conclusion: High dissociative PTSD patients displayed increased early (preconscious) cortical responses to emotional stimuli, and specific reductions to happy facial expressions in later (conscious), face-specific components compared to low dissociative PTSD patients. Dissociation in PTSD may act to increase initial pre-attentive processing of affective stimuli, and specifically reduce cortical reactivity to happy faces when consciously processing these stimuli.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:10","2018-12-21 18:15:10","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","dissociation; emotion; ERPs; faces; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the study looks at the phenomenon of work-life conflict and its impact on turnover intent. It also examined the moderating role of perceived organization support on the relationship between work-life conflict and turnover intent. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilized a two-phased, mixed-method approach. In the first phase, qualitative data from 30 interviews were obtained to validate the existence of the constructs among Filipino call center agents. In the second phase, 991 surveys were administered to quantitatively test the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. Findings - Results show that work-life conflict predicts intent to leave over and beyond that explained by job satisfaction. Findings also show that organizational support moderates the relationship between work-life conflict and intent to leave. The results also reveal the context-specific sources of work-life conflict: physical and psychological impact of work schedule, social isolation and lack of social support. Research limitations/implications - The study focused on work-life conflict and perceived organizational support. However, there are other variables that may be examined in future research such as personality, family, and organizational variables. Practical implications - Beyond the traditional responses to the issue of work-life conflict, the results suggest the importance of cultural nuanced responses to address work-life conflict. Social implications - Although outsourcing is a boon to the economy of developing countries, policies encouraging call centers need to be coupled with an understanding of the personal and social costs of call center work. Originality/value - This study highlights the importance of considering culture in viewing management practices and their impact on workers' behavior and wellbeing. It calls attention to the unique experience of call centers in developing countries and the importance of developing work-life interventions that are contextualized to local culture.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:11","2018-12-21 18:15:11","","349-365","","3","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Call centers; Call centres; Employees turnover; Perceived organizational support; Philippines; Turnover; Turnover intent; Work-life conflict","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we test the hypothesis that 2D:4D is robustly linked to aggression in “challenge” situations in which testosterone is increased. Participants were exposed to an aggressive video and a control video. Aggression was measured after each video and salivary free testosterone levels before and after each video. Compared to the control video, the aggressive video was associated with raised aggression responses and a marginally significant increase in testosterone. Left 2D:4D was negatively correlated with aggression after the aggressive video and the strength of the correlation was higher in those participants who showed the greatest increases in testosterone. Left 2D:4D was also negatively correlated to the difference between aggression scores in the aggressive and control conditions. The control video did not influence testosterone concentrations and there were no associations between 2D:4D and aggression.

Adaptive Influences on Intertemporal Choice and Risky Decision Making","EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY","","1474-7049","","","Informed by the research on adaptive decision making in other animal species, this study investigated human females' intertemporal and risky choices across the ovulatory cycle. We tested the hypothesis that at peak fertility, women who are exposed to environments that signal availability of higher quality mates (by viewing images of attractive males), become more impulsive and risk-seeking in economic decision tasks. To test this, we collected intertemporal and risky choice measures before and after exposure to images of either attractive males or neutral landscapes both at peak and low fertility conditions. The results showed an interaction between women's fertility status and image type, such that women at peak fertility viewing images of attractive men chose the smaller, sooner monetary reward option less than women at peak fertility viewing neutral images. Neither fertility status nor image type influenced risky choice. Thus, though exposure to images of men altered intertemporal choices at peak fertility, this occurred in the opposite direction than predicted-i.e., women at peak fertility became less impulsive. Nevertheless, the results of the current study provide evidence for shifts in preferences over the ovulatory cycle and opens future research on economic decision making.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:15","2018-12-21 18:15:15","","700-717","","3, SI","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","decision making; impulsivity; intertemporal choice; ovulatory cycle; risky choice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, while research has generally assumed that HR practices influence all employees in the same way, there is much evidence that employees' motives and needs change with age, suggesting that older workers may react differently to the same HR practices as compared to younger colleagues. This study seeks to shed light on this important and under-explored issue, analyzing whether the effect of HR development practices on job satisfaction (JS) and affective commitment is moderated by age in a sample of 37 companies located in Italy, involving a total of 6,182 employees. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Applying a multilevel approach, the results confirm a positive influence of HR development practices in increasing JS and affective commitment and show that this positive relationship weakens with age. Findings - Indeed, HR development practices were associated with lower JS and affective commitment for the oldest employees. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed suggesting the need to attribute greater consideration to age diversity when tailoring HR practices to improve their effect on employees' positive work attitudes. Originality/value - At the theoretical level, the paper contributes to the HRM literature debate, as the role of intervening variables such as age in the relationship between FAR practices and employees' attitudes is still an open issue. At the methodological level, the paper tested the hypotheses using a multilevel regression model. The paper combined data at individual and the organizational levels and adopted a multilevel approach in order to provide a better understanding of the way age can moderate the HRM-employee attitudes relationship.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:17","2018-12-21 18:15:17","","724-744","","6","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Affective commitment; Age; HR development practices; Job satisfaction; Multilevel analysis; Quantitative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study tested the hypothesis that thoughts about death may affect individuals' tendency to select or avoid entertainment media programming containing sexual material. In two experiments, thoughts about death (mortality salience [MS]) were manipulated before college undergraduates expressed interest in viewing television shows and movies with varying amounts of sexual content. In both studies, MS was associated with greater overall interest in sexual media content. Although terror management theory would indicate that sexual worldview should moderate this effect, this was not observed to be the case. In addition, MS was not found to affect interest in other types of highly engaging media content including violent and dramatic content. Limitations regarding generalizability are discussed. Results suggest that MS increases a preference for sexual media content, and that this occurs for individuals with diverse sexual values systems. This is discussed in terms of implications for terror management theory and cognitive models of media influence.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:18","2018-12-21 18:15:18","","55-64","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","death; sex; terror management theory; uses and gratifications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the current research is to study whether and to what extent the way parents have been parented influences the way they parent; Original data were collected from 48 families across three generations. Grandparents, parents and young adults were asked to report on how they had been parented, how they themselves had parented in the case of the grandparents' and parents' generations, or how they were planning to parent in the case of young adults without children. We tested the hypothesis of a “childrearing tradition” across three generations of respondents in a cross-sectional study with a non-clinical sample. Some arguments in favour of continuities have been found, in particular for supportive rather than for controlling parenting. The results hence suggest that reports on parenting behaviour correlate from one generation to the next and even across two non-consecutive generations. The similarities that have, been displayed result from the influence of the parenting individuals have received on the way. they themselves parent. Our results also suggest that such an influence may be higher for childreming attitudes such as warmth that have consistently been regarded as desirable, than for those that have been regarded as more controversial in society, such as harsh discipline.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:19","2018-12-21 18:15:19","","49-64","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a sample of 8 580 community-resident adults screened for the presence of personality disorders, the following predictions arising from this hypothesis were tested: first, that those with AABS co-morbid with BPD would, in comparison with those showing AABS or BPD only, show a high level of antisocial outcomes, including violence; second, that adjusting for co-morbid alcohol dependence would attenuate group differences in many of the antisocial outcomes, and violence in particular; and third, that the AABS/BPD group would show both a high prevalence and a high severity of CD, and that adjusting for co-morbid CD would attenuate any association found between AABS/BPD co-morbidity and violence. Results confirmed these predictions, suggesting that AABS/BPD co-morbidity mediates the relationship between childhood CD and a predisposition to adult violence. The triad of AABS/BPD co-morbidity, alcohol dependence and severe CD is likely associated with the risk of criminal recidivism in offenders with personality disorder following release into the community.

However, not much is known about whether electronic support is associated with subjectively reported patient health outcomes. This study examines variation in satisfaction with physical health status among users of self-help groups for patients with cancer (N=350). The analytical approach of the study differs from previous work in that satisfaction with physical health is modelled not as a predictor, but as an outcome variable. The study tested the hypothesis that perceived ability to cope with cancer mediates the association between electronic support and health satisfaction. Path analyses using ordinary least squares multiple regressions showed that there is an indirect association between electronic support and health satisfaction via perceived ability to cope with cancer. Electronic support increased perception of control over cancer, which in turn led to higher levels of satisfaction with health status. External health locus of control was associated with greater benefits derived from electronic support. This article concludes that the evaluation of physical health status includes not only clinical indicators but also subjective assessment of coping ability. Thus, the cyber social context in which health perceptions are developed has important medical implications for patient outcomes.","2013-01-01","2018-12-21 18:15:23","2018-12-21 18:15:23","","91-101","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","cancer; cyber patients; electronic coping support; hierarchical linear regression; self-efficacy; user psychology; virtual community","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach The paper examines how the mode of confrontation as well as the perpetrator's status relate to the alleged perpetrator's state of anger and the likelihood of providing a justification to the victim. To test the hypotheses, the authors conducted an experimental design using an organizational scenario. Findings The mode of confrontation predicts the likelihood of providing a justification to the victim. The paper also found that both anger and the likelihood of providing a justification for a charge of discrimination are higher when the mode of confrontation is indirect and the alleged perpetrator is the supervisor. Research limitations/implications An organizational scenario limits the realism of the study such that results may not generalize to actual organizational settings (Stone, Hosoda, Lukaszewski and Phillips). In addition, the response rate was low. Nevertheless, a full understanding of issues related to reactions to alleged discrimination will depend upon research conducted in a variety of settings under a variety of conditions. Practical implications It is unlikely that direct confrontations will be instrumental in correcting misperceptions of discriminatory behavior. Organizations need to provide training on how to manage confrontation episodes as an opportunity to mitigate perceived mistreatment. Originality/value Which mode of confrontation is best? Indirect confrontation is associated with a higher likelihood of the alleged perpetrator providing a justification for a charge of discrimination, particularly when the alleged perpetrator is the supervisor. However, anger is also higher when supervisors are confronted indirectly about allegations of discrimination.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:24","2018-12-21 18:15:24","","74-91","","1-2","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Anger; Direct confrontation; Discrimination; Indirect confrontation; Justification; Organizational behaviour; Reactions to alleged discrimination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The specific information used during bisection categorization has been a subject of debate. Recent research involving the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) suggests that the “short” anchor duration and a value near the geometric mean (GM) of the short and long anchors are among the critical pieces of information used during bisection categorization judgements. The present study examined a corollary of this claim, that memory comparison and decision-making processes related to the temporal judgments are completed prior to probe offset when probe durations are perceived to be “long;” testing the hypotheses that (I) response times would be significantly longer for “short” relative to “long” categorizations and that (2) there would be significant differences in ERPs time-locked to probe offset between probes judged to be “short” and “long.” Both of these predictions were realized in the results, providing strong support for the assertion that a value near the GM-likely the point of subjective equality (PSE)-is among the critical information used during bisection categorization judgments..

The neurobiological correlate of this phenomenon is the dysfunction of brain dopaminergic pathways. This article reviews the scientific evidence on the theoretical approaches of the dopaminergic hypothesis of psychosis and its relationship with the reward and salience systems. The aberrant salience occurs when the dysregulation of dopamine transmission produces a mistaken interpretation of neutral or irrelevant stimuli as a source of reward or punishment. Advances in neuroscience achieved in the Last decade have led to the conceptualization of the constructs of visual, social and emotional salience, to test the hypothesis of aberrant salience in psychosis. Psychosis appears, therefore as a trans-nosological pathological process, relatively nonspecific, which alters the attribution system of reality. (c) 2012 SEP y SEPB.

We test the hypotheses that the interaction is restricted to childhood maltreatment (as opposed to stressful events in adulthood), and leads to chronic depressive episodes (as opposed to any onset of depression), using gold-standard assessments of childhood maltreatment, severe life events, chronic depression, and new depressive onsets. Method In a risk-enriched sample of 273 unrelated women, childhood maltreatment was retrospectively assessed with the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA) interview and 5-HTTLPR was genotyped. A subset of 220 women was followed prospectively for 12 months with life events assessed with the Life Events and Difficulties (LEDS) interview. Any chronic episode of depression (12 months or longer) during adulthood and onset of a major depressive episode during a 12-month follow-up were established with the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) interview. Results The short alleles of 5-HTTLPR moderated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and chronic depression in adulthood, reflected in a significant geneenvironment interaction (RD = 0.226, 95% CI: 0.0760.376, P = .0032). 5-HTTLPR did not moderate the effects of either childhood maltreatment or severe life events on new depressive onsets. Conclusions The short variant of the serotonin transporter gene specifically sensitizes to the effect of early-life experience of abuse or neglect on whether an adult depressive episode takes a chronic course. This interaction may be responsible for a substantial proportion of cases of chronic depression in the general population. Depression and Anxiety 00:1-9, 2012.

Those, present before the incidence year were called antecedent FSSs; those with onset during the incidence year were called incident FSSs. In. each of two groups, 312 IC/PBS cases and 313 controls, rates of incident FSSs were compared among those with 0, 1, 2, or >= 3 antecedent FSSs. Confounding was assessed using logistic regression analyses that included the individual antecedent FSSs, published correlates of these FSSs, and demographic variables. Results: The incidence of a new FSS increased with the number of antecedent FSSs, as did that of incident FM, CFS and IBS Studied separately. These findings were not confounded by other variables. The Presence of multiple antecedent FSSs generally had the highest odds ratio for new, different, incident FSSs. Conclusions: This study revealed that the number of antecedent FSSs was among the Strongest risk factors for other FSSs, especially incident FM, CFS and IBS. This suggests that the FSSs are linked through a polysyndromic phenotype. If each FSS is heterogeneous, to seek a pathogenesis common to all FSSs, individuals with multiple FSSs should be sought; to seek a pathogenesis unique to a specific FSS, mature persons who have only that FSS should be studied.

Methods Regression analyses of longitudinal data at baseline through 6?months following breast cancer diagnosis examined the relationships between SOC (13-item version), daily assessment of coping with stressful events, health status, and QoL (EORTC QLQ-30). Results The findings support Antonovsky's concept of SOC. Women with strong SOC reported fewer stressful events and more days without stressful events. They used more coping strategies and more frequently used distraction, situation redefinition, direct action, and relaxation, but seldom religion, to cope with stressful events, and reported better health status and QoL. Women with weak SOC experienced more distress and used fewer coping strategies, and they more frequently used coping strategies such as catharsis and seeking social and spiritual support, but seldom acceptance of the situation. They reported worse health status and QoL, regardless of disease stage or treatment. The relationships between SOC and health status and QoL were linear. Conclusions Sense of coherence significantly predicts distress, number and type of coping strategies such as direct action and relaxation, health status, and QoL in women with breast cancer. Our data suggest that the SOC scale may be a useful screening tool to identify individuals particularly vulnerable to distress and unable to cope adequately. Assessing SOC strength may assist health care providers to provide individualized patient interventions.

Social cognitive processing theory is a useful framework for examining the effect of the social context on PTG. In theory, support interactions may either facilitate or hinder cognitive processing and thus lead to different PTG outcomes. The current study tested the hypothesis that emotional support and instrumental support would each explain a unique amount of the variance in PTG in distressed hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors. Additionally, it was predicted that social constraint on cancer-related disclosure would be negatively associated with PTG. Methods Forty-nine distressed HSCT survivors with a spouse or partner completed the posttraumatic growth inventory and measures of social support received from their spouse/partner and social constraint from people close to them as part of a larger clinical trial. Results Both emotional and instrumental social support were positively correlated with PTG, and social constraint on disclosure was not associated with PTG. Contrary to hypotheses, instrumental support was the only unique social contextual predictor of PTG. Conclusions The results of this study highlight the importance of examining the effects of subtypes of social support on PTG separately. Findings are discussed in the context of the cognitive (i.e., processing of the traumatic event) versus non-cognitive (i.e., buffering stress) pathways between the social context and PTG.

Few studies have addressed the progression of the deficit over time. The present investigation explores face emotion recognition (FER) performance throughout the course of schizophrenia. The aim of the study was to test the hypotheses that: 1) FER impairment was present in ultra high-risk (putatively prodromal) individuals, and that 2) impairment was stable across the course of the illness. Forty-three individuals with a putative prodromal syndrome, 50 patients with first episode of schizophrenia, 44 patients with multi-episode schizophrenia and 86 unaffected healthy control subjects were assessed to examine emotion recognition ability. ANCOVA analysis adjusted for possible confounder factors and subsequent planned contrasts with healthy controls was undertaken. The results revealed deficits in recognition of sadness and disgust in prodromal individuals, and of all negative emotions in both first-episode and multi-episode patients. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between clinical groups. Within the framework of the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, our results suggest the presence of emotional recognition impairment before the onset of full-blown psychosis. Moreover, the deficit remains stable over the course of illness, fitting the pattern of a vulnerability indicator in contrast to an indicator of chronicity or severity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that consumption of amphetamine and/or cocaine in addition to cannabis would lead to an earlier age at onset of schizophrenia than that seen for cannabis consumption alone. A secondary objective was to determine what kind of effect additional substance use exerted (e. g. additive, multiplicative). Method: Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited from consecutive admissions to the inpatient and outpatient services of a large psychiatric hospital in Perth, Australia and 167 participants were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis, which included detailed inquiry into illicit drug use in the 12 months prior to the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Participants were categorized into four groups: no illicit substance use (n = 65), cannabis use (n = 68), cannabis plus amphetamine use (n = 25), and cocaine plus cannabis/cocaine plus cannabis plus amphetamine use (n = 9). Analysis of variance was performed to detect trends, and linear regression used to analyze the consumption of each additional substance as a predictor of age at onset. Results: We observed a linear trend for mean age at onset: 23.34 (SD = 6.91) years for no illicit substance use, 22.51 (SD = 5.27) years for cannabis use, 20.84 (SD = 3.48) years for cannabis plus amphetamine use, and 19.56 (SD = 3.54) years for cocaine plus cannabis/cocaine plus cannabis plus amphetamine use; the variation in the means between groups was statistically significant: F(1,163) = 5.66, p = 0.008, Cohen's d = 0.38. For the consumption of each additional substance, age at onset was earlier by 1.2 years: R-2 = 0.034, F(1,165) = 5.72, p = 0.018. Conclusions: Whilst preliminary, these findings suggest that additional consumption of each substance predicted an earlier age at onset by approximately 1 additional year.","2013-01","2018-12-21 18:15:35","2018-12-21 18:15:35","","51-58","","1","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Amphetamine; cannabis; cocaine; dopamine; psychosis; schizophrenia; sensitization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, people show a strong resistance against changing their minds. These are well-established findings, which suggest that changed decisions carry a subjective cost, perhaps by being more strongly regretted. Three studies were conducted to explore participants' regret when making reversible decisions and to test the hypothesis that changing one's mind will increase post-outcome regret. The first two studies employed the Ultimatum game and the Trust game. The third study used a variant of the Monty Hall problem. All games were conducted by individual participants playing interactively against a computer. The outcomes were designed to capture a common characteristic of real-life decisions: they varied from rather negative to fairly positive, and for every outcome, it was possible to imagine both more and less profitable outcomes. In all experiments, those who changed their minds reported much stronger post-outcome regret than those who did not change, even if the final outcomes were equally good (Experiments 2 and 3) or better (Experiment 1).This finding was not because of individual differences with respect to gender, tendency to regret, or tendency to maximize. Previous studies have found that those who change from a correct to wrong option regret more than those who select a wrong option directly. This study indicates that this finding is a special case of a more general phenomenon: changing one's mind seems to come with a cost, even when one ends up with favorable outcomes.

Method: The Netherlands Mental Health and Incidence Study (NEMESIS-1) is a longitudinal study of mental disorders (n = 7075) with three measurements over a 3-year period. Risk factors, persistence of psychotic experiences, and clinical outcome were analyzed for groups with: i) no psychotic experiences, ii) only delusions, iii) only hallucinations, and iv) both delusions and hallucinations. Results: Hallucinations and delusions occurred together more often (T0, 3.5%; T1, 1.0%; T2, 0.9%) than that predicted by chance (T0, 1.0%; T1, 0.1%; T2, 0.04%). The group with both symptoms showed more first-rank-like delusions compared with the group with only delusions. Having both hallucinations and delusions, compared to isolated symptoms, was associated more strongly with risk factors, comorbid affective symptoms, negative symptoms, and persistence of psychotic experiences. This was not an artifact of having more symptoms in general. Conclusion: Experiencing both delusions and hallucinations is an indicator of greater etiological load resulting in more clinical outcome. A specific hallucinatory-delusional state may represent an early phase of exacerbation of aberrant attribution of salience, increasing risk for clinical outcome.","2013-01","2018-12-21 18:15:38","2018-12-21 18:15:38","","34-47","","1","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","delusions; hallucinations; prevention; risk; schizophrenia; subclinical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The language AN is typically reported as left-lateralized (LAN), whereas the music AN is typically reported as right-lateralized (RAN). However, several lines of evidence suggest syntactic processing of language and music rely on overlapping neural systems. The current study tested the hypothesis that syntactic processing of speech and music share neural resources by examining whether musical proficiency modulates ERP indices of linguistic syntactic processing. ERPs were measured in response to syntactic violations in sentences and chord progressions in musicians and non-musicians. Violations in speech were insertion errors in normal and semantically impoverished English sentences. Violations in music were out-of-key chord substitutions from distantly and closely related keys. Phrase-structure violations elicited an AN and P600 in both groups. Harmonic violations elicited an LPC in both groups, blatant harmonic violations also elicited a RAN in musicians only. Cross-domain effects of musical proficiency were similar to previously reported within-domain effects of linguistic proficiency on the distribution of the language AN; syntactic violations in normal English sentences elicited a LAN in musicians and a bilateral AN in non-musicians. The late positivities elicited by violations differed in latency and distribution between domains. These results suggest that initial processing of syntactic violations in language and music relies on shared neural resources in the general population, and that musical expertise results in more specialized cortical organization of syntactic processing in both domains.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:40","2018-12-21 18:15:40","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","ERAN; expertise; LAN; language; music; P600; sentence processing; syntax","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its original and most powerful version is the forced-choice procedure that continues to play an important role because it allows for an experimental approach to test the hypothesis of intentional symptom distortion. When conducting forced-choice tests, below-chance response patterns are considered to be indicative of this type of distortion. In this article, we discuss the rationale behind the forced-choice technique and its historical development. We also present three case vignettes that illustrate the experimental background of forced-choice testing and how it may help to clarify diagnostic issues. The diagnostic considerations in these cases concerned (1) complete memory loss, (2) Ganser syndrome, and (3) dementia. Employing forced-choice methodology, intentional false symptom production could be demonstrated in all three patients. Thus, the cases demonstrate how, in the context of substantial external benefits, forced-choice testing may help to determine whether healthy individuals try to appear psychologically impaired.

An implicit learning deficit would hinder detection of such dependencies, which mark grammatical relations (e.g. between `is' and `-ing' in `she is happily singing'). In a head-turn experiment with infants aged 1;6, family risk and typically developing infants were exposed to one of two novel languages containing dependencies of the type a-X-c, b-X-d or a-X-d, b-X-c, with fixed first and third elements and twenty-four different X elements. During test, typically developing children listened longer to ungrammatical strings (i.e. that did not correspond to their training language).

In contrast, cognitive attribution theories emphasize the importance of blaming oneself rather than others for negative events. Thus far, the contrasting predictions of these models have not been directly compared. Following the attributional perspective, we tested the hypothesis that people with remitted MDD show no overall bias towards negative emotions, but a selective bias towards self-blaming emotions relative to those emotions associated with blaming others. Sampling and Methods: We compared a remitted MDD and a control group on a novel experimental test that allowed us to directly compare proneness to specific emotions associated with different types of self-blame (guilt, shame, self-contempt/disgust) and blame of others (other-indignation/anger, other-contempt/disgust) whilst controlling for negative valence and medication status, and excluding comorbidity. Results: In agreement with our hypothesis, individuals with remitted MDD exhibited an increased self-contempt bias (difference between contempt/disgust towards self and others) but no increased proneness to any other negative emotion or overall increases in perceived negative valence of stimuli. Moreover, the remitted MDD group exhibited reduced contempt/disgust towards others. Conclusions: Our results corroborate the prediction that vulnerability to MDD is associated with an imbalance of specific self- and other-blaming emotions rather than a general increase in negative emotions. Based on the composition of our sample, we speculate that self-contempt bias may be particularly characteristic of melancholic MDD subtypes and could be useful for stratification of depression in the future.

Dysphoric college students randomly assigned to anticipate an interaction with a new person resembling a loved significant other showed increases in depressed mood and offered freely listed self-descriptions that were more characterized (according to judges) by a sense of “rejection” (relative to a control condition). No such effects occurred among non-dysphoric individuals. Dysphoric individuals may be especially vulnerable emotionally to expected encounters with new people who resemble loved family members by whom they have felt rejected.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:46","2018-12-21 18:15:46","","39-57","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Depression; Interpersonal schemas; Mental representations; Significant others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The repertory grid technique was used to elicit constructs from 30 young patients (10 anorexic, 10 bulimic, and 10 obese) and from a matched control group; the two sets of constructs were compared in terms of their semantic content. Overall the results confirmed the hypothesis, although further investigation into the semantic peculiarities of individual eating disorders is required. Methodological limitations and possible clinical applications are discussed.","2013","2018-12-21 18:15:47","2018-12-21 18:15:47","","62-76","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
